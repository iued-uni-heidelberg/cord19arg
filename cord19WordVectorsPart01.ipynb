        "\n",
        "Word vectors (also known as 'word embeddings') are one of the most popular kinds of AI models. They are extremely useful in many domains. In essence, a word vector is a set of numbers that attempt to capture the meaning of a word. In typical implementations, each word is represented by a set of 200-300 numbers. In linear algebra, a one-dimensional array of numbers is known as a 'vector', hence these sets of numbers representing words' meanings are known as 'word vectors'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using neural networks, we can expose the computer to a large amount of text, and allow it to learn an appropriate set of numbers for each word it encounters. In this notebook, we will learn about the most famous of all word vector algorithms, `word2vec`, which was first described by Tomas Mikolov and his team in 2013:\n",

        "\n",
        "Word vectors allow the computer to 'understand' language far more effectively. Rather than seeing each word as simply an arbitrarily different object, a computer using word vectors can analyse each word as a point in 200- or 300-dimenstional space. Words that are similar in meaning will have similar word vectors. And as we will see, the spaces between the word vectors are also significant: the words are arranged in patterns that represent their relationships to one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accordingly, most AI systems that process language now include a word vector layer as part of their architecure. When the system encounters some text (e.g. when you speak to Siri or Alexa), your words are converted into word vectors, *and then* the computer examines what the text says and determines how it should respond.\n",

CT finding of Covid-19 mainly include , subpleural and predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacity , a crazy-paving pattern , and/or consolidation with air bronchograms , usually with bilateral and multilobar involvement 3 . however , when a patient present with a pre-exist pathology ( such as UIP ) comparison with previous CT finding should be do to avoid miss a diagnosis of pulmonary involvement cause by SARS-CoV-2 infection . the presence of interstitial lung disease and ongoing immunosuppressive treatment may place patient with SSc at risk of develop more severe disease and high mortality when infect by SARS-CoV-2 2 .   a Hybrid Virtual Fracture Clinic be Safe and Efficacious in the COVID-19 Era : stay at Home and Save life in March @card@ , the World Health Organization ( who ) declare the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) viral infection as a pandemic cause by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV2 ) , belong to the coronaviridae family [ @card@ ] . since then , several country include the United Kingdom have suffer two or more wave of the pandemic , with many region across the world still grapple with a surge in infection . early review confirm the virus to be highly transmissible with a mortality rate between @card@ % and 2 % [ 3 ] . in the United Kingdom , social distancing guideline , lockdowns , and standard operate procedure be outline by the government and other organisation as infection rate and hospital admission of COVID-19 patient soar during March-April @card@ . the UK National Health Service ( NHS ) come under increase pressure , and the government issue the public message during the lockdown to ‘ Stay at Home . protect the NHS . Save live . ' the British Orthopaedic Association ( Boa ) issue clinical guideline for patient management use remote consultation [ 4 ] . these include deliver follow-up appointment by telephone or video call , and the non-operative treatment of fracture where possible , particularly for upper limb fracture . NHS guideline also specify patient who would not require physical examination or test , after carry out the risk assessment and exclude exception criterion [ 5 ] . keep in line with these guideline , virtual clinic be initiate and/or expand in various hospital in the United Kingdom . telephone consultation and virtual clinic be previously under practice and have be review in various study [ @card@ ] . the requirement to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of virtual clinic to face-to-face clinic be emphasise by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( Nice ) in @card@ [ 7 ] . the importance of virtual clinic in deliver healthcare to remote location be know . while previous study regard virtual fracture clinic have show these to be useful , effective , and more economical , they focus exclusively on remote consultation [ @card@ ] . however , the present pandemic necessitate the use of virtual clinic with the main aim of reduce patient footfall in hospital . the Trauma and Orthopaedics department at our institution start a ' hybrid virtual fracture clinic ' ( HVFC ) service that be bespeak to the patient - either a face-to-face or telephone consultation , or both , depend on the patient requirement . patient be inform regard the mode of consultation appropriate for their need , depend on their vulnerability to the coronavirus , orthopaedic condition , and any particular requirement for management of the same . in the present article , we review this HVFC model use objective patient satisfaction score and patient-reported outcome for this novel service . this be a retrospective study conduct at the outpatient department of a Level 1 Major Trauma Centre ( MTC ) in London . patient who be book to attend the fracture clinic service during the first two week of the national lockdown in the United Kingdom ( March @card@ , @card@ , to April 5 , @card@ ) during the coronavirus pandemic be include in the analysis . patient be contact and the study questionnaire be conduct by telephone by the author ( AS and MIB ) between June and July @card@ . verbal consent be obtain from all patient prior to the questionnaire . the study be register with the institution 's clinical audit department . Two follow-up phone-call attempt be make for unavailable patient . all patient over the age of @card@ year be include in the study . those less than @card@ year of age and those who do not attend ( DNA ) the appointment/were not contactable at the time of appointment , be exclude . in elderly patient or those with dementia , response from their primary carer be accept . we note the total number of virtual ( telephone ) and/or face-to-face consultation each patient attend up until the time of the questionnaire and use this datum to later differentiate patient who have only virtual , only face-to-face , or ‘ hybrid ' consultation . we also note the type of condition ( upper limb , low limb , or spine/pelvis/other ) , whether these patient be discharge from the HVFC or still under follow-up , and whether they require surgery as part of their treatment . we note the number of new patient , and how many of these have their first appointment within @card@ hour of their injury . patient be classify as vulnerable or non-vulnerable to COVID-19 base on the who criterion , take into account their age and medical co-morbidities . these criterion have also be publish and follow by the NHS [ 5 ] . patient experience of the HVFC be assess use a validate questionnaire , which include the net Promoter Score ( NPS ) , Customer Effort Score ( CES ) , and Customer Satisfaction Score ( CSS ) . these score be evaluate on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be the bad and @card@ be the well possible score . the NPS ask patient to rate their likelihood to recommend a service to a friend or colleague [ 8 ] . the CES be a single item metric that measure how much effort a customer/patient have to exert to get an issue resolve , a request fulfill , a service acquire or a question answer [ 9 ] . the CSS be a measurement of overall customer/patient satisfaction with a certain service or product [ @card@ ] . moreover , patient be also ask about the likelihood of their use the HVFC format in the absence of a pandemic , and score this on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be not likely at all , and @card@ be extremely likely . Patient-reported outcome be assess use the validate EuroQol Group 5D-5L ( EQ-5D-5L ) score , consist of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the Eq Visual Analogue Scale ( EQ-VAS ) . the descriptive part include question about the patient ' ease of mobility , self-care , routine activity , pain/discomfort , and anxiety or depression . the EQ-VAS require patient to score their own health on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be the bad and @card@ be the well possible health [ @card@ ] . the anonymity of all the recorded datum be ensure during its processing and electronic analysis . Data entry be do in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the final analysis be do use Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) software ( IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version @card@ . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp ) . the comparison of the net promoter score , customer effort score , customer satisfaction score , and self-rated EQ-VAS score between different mode of consultation be do use the Kruskal Wallis test . comparison of the descriptive component of the EQ-5D-5L ( which be qualitative parameter ) be analyse use the Fisher’s exact test . a p-value of less than @card@ be consider significant . of @card@ possible adult age group patient that attend the HVFC during the study period , @card@ patient respond to the telephone call and the questionnaire . of these , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be male while @card@ ( @card@ % ) be female . the mean age be @card@ year ( range @card@ year ) . table 1 show the distribution of patient base on vulnerability to COVID-19 , surgical or non-surgical management , and follow-up status at the time of the questionnaire . patient with low limb condition constitute the majority of those in HVFC ( Figure 1 ) . the mean NPS , CES , and CSS of the hybrid virtual fracture clinic score on a scale of @card@ be @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ , respectively . the mean likelihood of use the HVFC in the absence of a pandemic be @card@ ( Table 2 ) . there be @card@ new patient refer from the accident and emergency department , of which @card@ ( @card@ % ) have their first consultation within @card@ hour . there be @card@ consultation , of which @card@ be conduct virtually , save @card@ ( @card@ % ) hospital visit . overall , @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) have only face-to-face consultation , @card@ ( @card@ % ) have only virtual consultation , while @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) have hybrid consultation ( Figure 2 ) . a Kruskal Wallis test be do to compare the outcome of different mode of consultation ( face-to-face , hybrid , and virtual ) . there be no statistically significant difference across NPS , CES , CSS , or EQ-VAS rating between the group ( Table 3 ) . patient who have hybrid consultation tend to report good NPS , CES , and EQ-VAS score than those who have virtual consultation only , although this difference do not reach statistical significance . patient with face-to-face consultation have the high mean NPS of @card@ ( Figure 3 ) . patient in the vulnerable group tend to report well overall mean score than the non-vulnerable group include a high mean EQ-VAS health score , but this difference do not reach statistical significance ( p = @card@ ) ( Figure 4 ) . patient who require surgery as part of their treatment report bad overall mean score than those who do not , although this difference do not reach statistical significance ( Table 4 ) . there be a significant difference in the pain component rating of the EQ-5D-5L , with surgical patient report high pain level compare to patient manage non-surgically ( p = @card@ ) . patient who do not require surgery tend to report increase customer satisfaction score , as represent in the Box-Whisker plot ( Figure 5 ) . patient already discharge from the service report high overall mean score include a high EQ-VAS ( Table 4 ) . there be a significant difference between the pain component of EQ-5D-5L , with patient still under follow-up report high pain level ( p < @card@ ) . patient who be still under follow-up also report significantly high anxiety level compare to those discharge ( p = @card@ ) on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire . the NHS be face increase pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic , affect the delivery of all service , include orthopaedic fracture clinic . the pandemic have highlight the significance of remote consultation to reduce hospital visit and have lead to newfound practice with a fresh interest in the efficiency and efficacy of virtual clinic across all specialty . the give circumstance result in the Boa recommend only unavoidable patient-initiated follow-up in fracture clinic through new guideline during the pandemic [ 4 ] . the need to protect the vulnerable group from COVID-19 exposure hold particular importance while plan virtual clinic . in our hospital , this need , combine with the need to reduce overall patient footfall , result in the formulation of the hybrid virtual fracture clinic . previous study have suggest high satisfaction ratio and acceptance of virtual fracture clinic among patient ; however , all of these have focus solely on virtual consultation [ 7 ] . To the good of our knowledge , no previous study have evaluate the outcome and patient satisfaction with a hybrid format of the clinic . the hybrid virtual fracture clinic ( HVFC ) format be bespeak to patient need - combine virtual and face-to-face consultation as appropriate for management . our result indicate that patient satisfaction and clinical outcome with virtual and hybrid format of consultation be similar to those with traditional face-to-face consultation . also , patient with at least one face-to-face consultation in combination with virtual consultation , tend to have good satisfaction and outcome score than those with only virtual consultation . patient vulnerable to COVID-19 have report excellent outcome across all measure in our study . their superior satisfaction score compare to non-vulnerable patient , highlight their recognition of the HVFC enable them to isolate themselves at home while be provide effective outpatient care . our result also show that patient with orthopaedic condition not require surgery may be most suit to this hybrid format , as such patient tend to report good satisfaction and clinical outcome measure compare to those require surgical management . the relatively low satisfaction score in surgical patient may partly be due to high pain level , as highlight by the significantly high rating of the pain component of EQ-5D-5L in patient require surgery . the HVFC have the significant benefit of minimize hospital visit of patient vulnerable to COVID-19 while continue to provide clinical outcome comparable to face-to-face consultation . our result show that with this hybrid format , we be able to reduce footfall by @card@ % , with equivalent patient satisfaction and outcome . the HVFC format could provide an efficient and economical model for conduct fracture clinic in the future , reduce the burden of face-to-face consultation . another important benefit of the HVFC be reduce travel , especially in the current era of climate change , with a huge emphasis be on promote sustainable healthcare . there be a drive towards devise strategy to make the NHS and surgical practice overall , more environment friendly [ @card@ ] . the HVFC format , reduce travel to clinic appointment by over @card@ % , while provide efficient outpatient care , can certainly help promote this . technological advance have highly enable televidimedicine [ @card@ ] and virtual clinic have be study in the past regard their outreach to remote location , and their economical benefit [ @card@ ] . virtual fracture clinic ( VFCs ) have be initiate in the United Kingdom previously with the intention to meet the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma ( Boast ) guideline that require a trauma patient to be review at a fracture clinic within @card@ hour of present to the emergency department , and have be find to be in compliance with this guideline [ @card@ ] . we attribute our low compliance to this guideline , to the timing of our study at the commencement of lockdown , and re-organisation of clinic list during this period , result in a delay in new appointment . potential cost reduction be another benefit of an HVFC model . the Glasgow Fracture Pathway conclude a cost save of approximately @card@ % use virtual consultation [ @card@ ] . similarly , McKirdy and Imbuldeniya conclude that an amount of @card@ GBP be conserve within the first year of implementation of virtual clinic , and predict to save approximately @card@ GBP every year after that [ 7 ] . also , the incorporation of virtual consultation can increase the overall capacity of the fracture clinic . Logishetty and Subramanyam show a rise of 8 % in the total outpatient fracture appointment after the implementation of a virtual fracture clinic [ @card@ ] . Rhind et al . do a literature review that indicate the advantage of merge VFCs and face-to-face consultation . in their review , @card@ % of patient be satisfy after VFC consultation . a decrease in non-attendance of almost @card@ % be note . they also note that VFCs do not impede the training and education of trainee [ @card@ ] . as we include patient with vary orthopaedic condition , we be unable to comment , from our result , on whether patient with certain condition may fare good with the HVFC than other . however , previous study on VFCs have show their effectiveness for the management of a number of orthopaedic injury not require surgical intervention . these include patient with simple radial head fracture , little finger metacarpal fracture , fifth metatarsal fracture , and buckle fracture in child [ @card@ ] . Bhattacharya et al . find that patient with undisplaced clavicle fracture can be discharge after a single virtual consultation with good patient outcome and satisfaction [ @card@ ] . similarly , the Boa COVID guideline now encourage early definitive management of such injury with virtual/patient-initiated follow-up , in order to minimise subsequent visit to the fracture clinic [ 4 ] . previous VFCs have be show to have good outcome in term of patient satisfaction . in the study by Hawarden et al . , the VFC be think to be good or excellent by @card@ % of responder . Ninty-seven percent respond that they would be likely or extremely likely to suggest the VFC to family member or friend [ @card@ ] . Jayram et al . show satisfaction range from @card@ % to @card@ % in patient with radial head or neck fracture manage solely with virtual consultation [ @card@ ] . the HVFC format reduce patient footfall significantly ( >50 % ) while provide effective and satisfactory outpatient care during the first COVID-19 wave . there be no difference in patient-reported outcome between face-to-face consultation , hybrid , or virtual consultation thus show that the HVFC be a safe and efficacious method for outpatient management of orthopaedic trauma , in line with Boa guideline . patient would recommend this service to other , they find it easy to use and report a good experience . it enable patient to stay at home , which in turn ease pressure on public healthcare , which could , in turn , save life in keep with United Kingdom public health promotion .   analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on house-staff in the USA : address the ripple effect the COVID-19 ( Corona Virus Disease-19 ) pandemic have place unprecedented demand on healthcare worker around the world , and their response to the challenge have be both courageous and inspiring . unfortunately , front-line healthcare worker have be negatively impact in several way . firstly , lack of personal protective equipment have lead to anxiety and concern amongst physician regard not just their own safety , but also the safety of their family and love one [ @card@ ] . secondly , observe first-hand the toll that the pandemic have take on their community , include sometimes their own colleague have negatively affect the mental well-being of healthcare worker [ 3 ] . finally , and most devastatingly , thousand of physician world-wide have lose their life in the fight against COVID-19 [ 4 ] . many training program have try to limit exposure to COVID ( + ) patient for house officer , but nonetheless resident physician have experience the same stressors as more senior colleague . they have suffer anxiety due to a lack of PPE and mental distress from observe the serious impact of of the pandemic on their community [ 5 ] . despite duty hour restriction , resident report that shift during the pandemic have be more rigorous [ 6 ] . educational activity have take a back seat due to increase workload and social distancing , elective rotation have be cancel , and there have be a reduce focus on outpatient care , all of which have culminate in a more labor-intensive experience [ 7 ] . these change have not only affect the personal life and well-being of house officer just as they have every other frontline worker , but they have also suddenly and dramatically change the face of residency training . we conduct a cross-sectional survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on the life and training of resident physician from April to June @card@ . the survey be disseminate via e-mails and social medium . initial question be yes/no , and design to assess the overall impact of the pandemic on resident physician ' life and training . next , resident be ask to rate , on a scale of 1 to @card@ , the degree to which they be concern about particular issue ( question 1 to @card@ ) and the degree to which their well-being be affect ( question @card@ to @card@ ) . response be categorize as ‘ not significantly [ 1–4 ] ' , ‘ somewhat significantly [ 5–7 ] ' and ‘ significantly [ 8–10 ] . ' the statistical analysis be perform use R software v @card@ . feel significantly overwhelm by the pandemic be not associate with direct involvement in the care of confirm or suspect COVID-19 case ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) or have dependent to take care of at home ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . paradoxically , house-staff with underlie chronic medical problem be actually less likely than their healthy colleague to report be significantly overwhelmed ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . table 1 show a quantitative analysis of the response from house-staff . resident who report the high level of concern about their ability to take care of their patient do not report increase level of concern about paranoia among patient ( p < @card@ ) , lack of communication from authority ( p < @card@ ) or lack of personal knowledge or understanding regard COVID-19 ( p = @card@ ) . those who have the high level of concern about the availability of PPE or increase patient load do not report an increase in concern about their ability to take care of patient ( p = @card@ ) . resident who be somewhat concern about the lack of protective equipment be , not surprisingly , significantly concern about their ability to protect themselves from the infection ( p < @card@ ) . there be three group of resident most likely to report that the pandemic have impact both their physical and mental health : house-officers feeling overwhelm by the pandemic ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ and physical health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ ) , those concerned about their ability to safeguard themselves from COVID-19 ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ and physical health χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ ) , and finally , those who be concern about be able to take care of their family and love one ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p = @card@ and physical health χ2 = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . the final question be a free text and offer participant the opportunity to share any positive change they have witness . about @card@ % respondent leave comment , and the content vary widely . Two general theme do emerge . about @card@ % of respondent be please with the unity and camaraderie amongst co-worker and colleague . about @card@ % respondent be happy with the pro-activeness of their hospital or program in deal with the crisis . roughly @card@ % respondent state that they do not witness any positive change in the current time . the current survey be limit by its small sample size . we send out the survey when hospital across the state be deal with high patient volume and therefore most resident be likely unable to respond to survey in a timely manner due to patient care-related responsibility . our current sample size represent <1 % of the resident physician training across the nation . also , presumably most of the respondent belong to internal medicine residency program in our analysis , which make the study sample less representative of resident physician from other specialty . gradual variation in local government rule relate to lockdown may have also affect the stress level among resident train in those state , which would also have affectedthe result of our survey . since the pandemic impacted state in wave , a follow-up of current response would help capture the overall impact of the pandemic on resident in a more thorough manner . it be also possible that we be not able to capture response from resident who be on busy rotation at the time the survey be send out . this may have lead to some underestimation of the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . there may also have be some selection bias , in that those resident who have strong feeling about the effect of the pandemic would be more likely to respond to the survey . the result of our survey indicate that the overall well-being of trainee have be significantly affect by the ongoing pandemic . rapid implementation by residency program and hospital of measure to ensure the mental and physical well-being of resident be need on multiple level . first and foremost , the importance of adequate personal protective equipment can be overstate . there be also a need for community support to ensure safe care for child and elderly family member of all frontline worker , include house officer . on the positive side , resident have acknowledge that they have come closer to their colleague and co-worker in these time and have appreciate the preparedness of their respective hospital in deal with the pandemic . again , it be worth mention that feeling overwhelm by the pandemic be independent of be directly involve in the care of COVID-19 patient . such a phenomenon could be relate to the vicarious trauma suffer by some resident who feel extreme sympathy for COVID-19 patient and other physician who be work directly with them [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] . regardless of the cause , mental or physical health-based intervention should target resident irrespective of their direct involvement in the care of infected patient and should be initiate immediately . timely intervention to regularize work responsibility , provide adequate protection and safety to house-staff and ensure their overall well-being in these unusually challenging time will go a long way in define the future of healthcare both nationally and worldwide .   towards Quantitative and Standardized Serological and Neutralization Assays for COVID-19 the global response to COVID-19 have spur innovation in diagnostic , surveillance , and vaccine development at an unprecedented pace . robust and quantitative serological and neutralization assay be key measurement for assess the complex patient response to SARS-CoV-2 , the coronavirus that cause COVID-19 [ 1 ] . for example , serological assay be critical for measure the individual and the population exposure to COVID-19 . mild and asymptomatic case constitute the majority of infection [ 2 ] , and reliable serological assay be need to determine the seroprevalence as well as full geographical dispersion of people who carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus . rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody have be recognize as an invaluable tool in track and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 3 ] . in the context of overall hospital operation , reliable and convenient serologic assay could play a significant role in establish the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment scale to guide the treatment of exist illness in old patient , for example toxicity risk of chemotherapy in cancer ward [ 4 ] . the assay could also provide datum during triage prior to patient admittance and minimize spread of COVID-19 among the hospital health worker [ 5 ] . serological assay be also fundamental for the measurement of complex humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 . moreover , serological assay will have an increase role to evaluate the efficacy and durability of various COVID-19 vaccine now available or soon to be available . however , current serology result be highly variable [ 6 ] , in part due to a lack of well characterize , globally traceable reference material need for assay validation and control . as a part of the hierarchy of the global standardization of serologic testing , a robust , quantitative reference assay be urgently need to support various response to the pandemic . the ideal serological assay detect and quantify viral specific antibody in the blood serum or plasma from a previously infected person [ 7 ] . the assay generally involve immobilize specific viral epitopes that bind viral specific antibody onto a substrate . upon exposure to a blood sample , the substrate bound , viral specific antibody be measure . example of such serological assay include Elisa [ 8 ] , luminescence kit [ 9 ] , and immunochromatographic card [ @card@ ] . up to now , several SARS-CoV2 serology assay , e. g. , Roche’s Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay , have win FDA EUA approval as semi-quantitative serology assay . however , for serology assay to be truly quantitative , universal high quality reference antibody standard be require to enable assay quantification and standardization . in vitro neutralization assay can help to assess the ability of neutralize antibody ( Nab ) present in serum or plasma to inhibit cell binding or block entry into the person’s cell . neutralize antibody be characterize by their exceptional affinity to the viral epitopes generally involve in viral cell entry . for SARS-CoV-2 , the viral infection occur largely mediate by the receptor bind domain ( RBD ) , a part of the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein [ @card@ ] , which bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor on the human cell and facilitate cell entry . antibody against the RBD be highly correlative with neutralize activity [ @card@ ] . this have spur the development of antibody panel design to bind RBD and other epitopes in its vicinity [ @card@ ] . conventional virus neutralization assay require the handling of live/active SARS-CoV-2 in a specialized biosafety level 3 ( BSL3 ) containment facility and be time-consuming ( 2–4 day to complete ) and labor intensive [ @card@ ] . recently develop pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay can be perform in a BSL2 facility [ @card@ ] ; however , these assay still require the use of live virus and cell . surrogate neutralization assay that require no live virus and cell and that can yield result in a few hour in a BSL2 laboratory have be develop [ @card@ ] . good correlation between conventional virus , pseudovirus , and surrogate neutralization assay have be show [ @card@ ] . clearly , BSL-3 sparing , rapid neutralization assay that be high throughput ready and scalable be in demand for assess the efficacy and durability of vaccine [ @card@ ] . this manuscript describe a novel and quantitative flow cytometry-based assay utilize microsphere ( also call bead or microbeads in the following ) with immobilize antigen that capture antibody specific to SARS-COV-2 . the spike and RBD antigen be immobilize on two bead population with distinct fluorescence address . fluorescent phycoerythrin ( PE)-labeled secondary antibody be use to detect the presence of the capture antibody on the surface of the bead . the use of an RBD specific reference IgG standard enable the quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer in patient sample . a sensitive surrogate flow cytometry-based neutralization assay utilize microbeads couple with RBD and biotinylated ACE2 protein be develop . significant correlation between the result obtain from serological RBD IgG assay and surrogate neutralization assay be observe . as part of the effort to optimize assay performance , three different type of microbeads be evaluate to select the most appropriate bead . the selection criterion include bead that provide the high signal-to-noise , low microbead aggregation , and consideration with respect to the ease of use for the overall assay workflow . the same number of MagPlex-Avidin , SeroMap , or MagPlex-C microbeads be conjugate with the same amount of a RBD ( Ragon ) . Mab S562-109 spike in a negative serum ( Nist SRM 909c ) and positive plasma control ( NIBSC convalescent plasma code : @card@ ) dilute in PBT buffer serve as the two positive control . as show in Figure 1A , signal-to-noise ratio from MagPlex-Avidin microsphere be the low from both positive control and thus eliminate . the signal-to-noise ratio from SeroMap bead be high from the positive plasma control , but low from the Mab S562-109 positive control when compare to the MagPlex-C bead . as MagPlex-C bead be dope with a magnetic material , which facilitate various washing step require by the assay , they be choose as the substrate on which all subsequent serological assay be perform . next , we optimize the amount of antigenic protein conjugate to the microbeads for each protein in order to achieve the high sensitivity . Figure 1B illustrate the signal-to-noise ratio for microbeads conjugate with different amount of spike antigen against anti-spike IgG in the positive plasma control . different dilution of the positive plasma control , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , with respect to the same dilution of the negative serum SRM 909c as the assay background be evaluate . the high signal-to-noise ratio come from MagPlex-C conjugate with @card@ µg of spike protein ; therefore , this formulation be select for the measurement of anti-spike IgG in all subsequent serological assay . the same optimization strategy be apply to all other viral antigen . as a result , @card@ µg of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , 5 µg of SARS-CoV-2 RBD , @card@ µg of MERS , @card@ µg of SARS , @card@ µg of OCT43 , or @card@ µg of HKU1 be couple to @card@ × @card@ MagPlex-C bead with a spectrally distinct region for each viral antigen for optimize performance and to enable multiplex ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . To further improve assay performance , viral antigen from different source be evaluate . specially , the signal-to-noise ratio from bead immobilize with RBD from two source and spike antigen from two source be evaluate use both positive control . Ragon’s RBD and VRC’s spike be select as the antigen for all subsequent assay . the limit-of-detection ( Lod ) be determine by analyze a training sample set which consist of a know number of positive and negative sample . figure 2 show the logarithmic MFI ( log10 MFI ) value for the four SARS-CoV-2 serological assay : RBD IgG assay ( A ) , spike IgG assay ( B ) , RBD IgM assay ( C ) , and spike IgM assay ( D ) . note that the IgG and IgM assay be run in a duplexed format , with both RBD and spike coated bead in a sample well , to increase the throughput . we compute the sample mean and sample standard-deviation ( SD ) of log-transformed MFI value for negative sample and define the Lod ( black horizontal line ) as this mean + 3s . the LODs at various sample dilution for the four assay be summarize in Table 1 . in all case , the Lod improve at high sample dilution . additionally , high LODs be obtain for the RBD IgM assay , likely due to non-specific interference from other immunoglobins present in the sample include other non-SARS-CoV-2 antibody . the assay’s sensitivity and specificity be evaluate in term of its ability to correctly identify positive and negative sample from a set of @card@ blind sample consist both positive ( sample from patient who have have a positive PCR result for COVID-19 ) and negative ( healthy donor sample from pre-pandemic ) from two separate evaluation study . figure 3 show highly correlate logarithmic MFI value of anti-RBD versus value of anti-spike at the @card@ sample dilution for IgG assay ( A ) and IgM assay ( B ) , respectively . sample fall to the left of or below the Lod green line be consider to be negative , whereas sample fall outside of this region be consider to be positive . use the current Lod method , we observe a false positive IgG serology result ( blue circle ) on a negative training sample and a false negative IgM serology result ( red cross ) on a positive training sample . the discrepancy between serology and PCR result be not unexpected as the presence and concentration of various biomarkers be highly dependent on the timing of the sample collection with respect to viral exposure/infection [ @card@ ] . the Lod method be apply to the blind sample ( black diamond ) to assess assay sensitivity , specificity , and prevalence [ @card@ ] . base on this set of sample , the sensitivity and specificity of our serological IgG assay be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively . for the IgM assay , the sensitivity and specificity be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively . as note above , the assay sensitivity determine use the Lod method be highly dependent on the training sample . the result further highlight the need for standard and reference controls/reference material with different level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to enable comparison of assay performance across different assay format and harmonization of assay result . the cross reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay be evaluate use four human coronaviruses ( accessible to us at the time of assay development ) , SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV . both IgG and IgM assay be conduct in a quadruple fashion , enable by utilize four different microbeads of different fluorescence intensity address , each pair with a different coronaviral antigen ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . a sequence alignment of these five human coronavirus spike protein be provide as the Supplementary Materials . for both IgG and IgM assay , we observe no linear correlation between SARS-CoV-2 spike and the other four coronavirus spike antigen investigate . in addition , interference from both SARS and MERS in both IgG and IgM assay at the @card@ sample dilution be negligible as show in Figure 4 . on the other hand , many negative sample exhibit high titer of anti-OC43 and anti-HKU1 IgG . among the common cold coronaviruses , the anti-OC43 antibody titer be much high than those of anti-HKU1 , indicative of potential noncorrelative interference . these result be not surprising because the two common cold virus be widespread in the general population . To enable quantification of IgG , we establish a calibration curve use a mAb of know concentration against SARS-CoV RBD that be available and exhibit strong binding affinity to RBD . the calibration curve be then use to determine the concentration of IgG in the patient sample . Mab S562-109 be use as the IgG reference control in the generation of the calibration curve ( Figure 5 ) . specifically , reference solution with different concentration of Mab S562-109 be use to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen immobilize on the MagPlex-C bead . the binding reaction lead to equilibrium MFI value of the RBD IgG assay at each concentration of Mab S562-109 . as Mab S562-109 concentration increase , the MFI value of the RBD assay increase . the MFI value reach a plateau when the concentration of Mab S562-109 be sufficiently high to saturate the binding to accessible and immobilize RBD antigen . the binding affinity between the Mab S562-109 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD be sufficiently high ( private communication with Dr. Corbett at NIAID , NIH ) that at low concentration all mAb S562-109 in buffer solution be bind to the RBD antigen on the bead . we validate this assumption via high concentration of PE-labeled , secondary anti-human IgG Fc , which be use to ensure the detection of all mAb S562-109 bind to the bead surface . as note earlier , we assume that the binding reaction between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody in patient sample and the immobilize RBD antigen on the bead surface to be the same as that from the generation of the calibration curve . use this scheme , the measured MFI value enable the quantification of anti-RBD antibody titer in patient sample . as a rule of thumb , the linear range of the calibration curve ( @card@ to @card@ ng/mL , grey line ) be preferentially use to compute the anti-RBD antibody titer due to the high measurement confidence . for sample with MFI value outside of the linear calibration range , a logistic calibration curve give by Equation ( 1 ) ( orange line ) be utilize to calculate the antibody titer . the titer of some of the convalescent patient sample be display on the x-axis in Figure 6 . the error bar around the datum point be combined uncertainty estimate from sample replicate and the fitting procedure . the presence of NAbs be determine via the surrogate assay by quantify binding between RBD and biotinylated ACE2 protein in suspension . the binding reaction be recognize by the PE fluorescence signal after the addition of streptavidin-PE conjugate . in the absence of Nab , all RBD on the bead surface be bind to ACE2 and detect by fluorescence signal from the PE molecule . in the presence of Nab , on the other hand , the RBD/ACE2 binding be reduce due to competition with RBD/NAb binding , which result in a reduce pe fluorescence signal . the percentage of signal reduction due to the presence of Nab be calculate with respective to the signal obtain at the high sample dilution in which the amount of Nab be negligible . as a result , a curve of sample dilution vs. signal reduction % be generate ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . NT50 , the neutralization antibody titer and sample dilution at which @card@ % of the RBD site be occupy by Nab , be determine through curve fit to Equation ( 4 ) . the NT50 value of the convalescent patient sample be exhibit on the y-axis in Figure 6 along with error bar around the data point display uncertainty estimate from sample replicate and curve fitting procedure . several COVID-19 serological assay have be develop and report recently use the Luminex platform , although none have be demonstrate to be quantitative [ @card@ ] . while our serological assay utilize the MagPlex-C bead commonly use on the Luminex platform , our assay use the flow cytometry platform instead of more specialized Luminex equipment . hence , the assay may be more easily implement in different center as flow cytometry platform be widely available . additionally , flow cytometry afford us the ability to improve and optimize the assay performance base on the measurement target more rapidly . for example , as show in Figure 1A , while the signal-to-noise ratio from the SeroMap bead be high than that from the MagPlex-C bead , a detailed examination clearly show that the percentage of RBD-coupled SeroMap bead doublet be more than twice the percentage of RBD-coupled MagPlex-C bead doublet . although the bead doublet be typically gat out in the Luminex assay , the presence of doublet introduce bias in the quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody due to the exclusion of a significant number of antibody bind to bead doublet . moreover , the use of MagPlex-C bead facilitate essential washing step require by high confidence serological assay . with available antigen of anti-SARS-CoV-2 variant [ @card@ ] , the developed microbead conjugation protocol be currently apply for the development of serology assay for the viral variant such as B.1.351 lineage from South Africa . the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay be evaluate use four other human coronaviruses : SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV . a high variability in the sequence of the spike protein in the S1 and RBD domain of these coronavirus ( Supplementary Materials ) suggest that antibody generate against these two domain will be highly subtype specific . conversely , the S2 domain of the spike protein sequence be highly conserve across the human coronaviruses , indicative of potential increase cross reactivity [ @card@ ] . as show in Figure 4 , interference from SARS1 and MERS in both IgG and IgM assay be negligible at the @card@ sample dilution . at the same sample dilution , a significant portion of sample exhibit high titer of anti-OC43 and anti-HKU1 IgG . the anti-OC43 antibody titer be high than those of anti-HKU1 and , in some case , be similar in magnitude as those of anti-SARS-CoV-2 . similar observation have be report [ @card@ ] . our non-SARS-CoV-2 serology assay be run in a quadruple manner and therefore require less assay time and sample volume than a typical Elisa assay [ @card@ ] . Two other common coronaviruses , 229E-CoV and NL63-CoV [ @card@ ] may also exhibit some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 . however , they be not include in the present study since we be unable to obtain their viral spike protein . SARS-CoV-2 have cause a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-exist cross-reactive antibody to S2 domain and nucleocapsid protein in most individual [ @card@ ] . this observation be consistent with the idea that RBD and S1 domain be more likely to generate subtype-specific serological test for population surveillance of infection and humoral response monitoring of vaccination . To our knowledge , a high-quality serological reference standard do not yet exist for absolute quantification of various antibody against SARS-CoV-2 . in this study , we use Mab S562-109 , an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV as the reference standard for the quantification of anti-RBD IgG titer . a calibration curve be generate use mAb S562-109 spike in negative serum Nist SRM 909c . use this calibration curve , we be able to quantify the anti-RBD IgG titer of convalescent patient sample over a large concentration span three order of magnitude ( @card@ µg/mL to @card@ ng/mL ) . quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer be report use Elisa and a commercial anti-RBD monoclonal IgG [ @card@ ] . though no quantification detail be provide , the report show that the anti-RBD antibody titer in the same range from approximately @card@ µg/mL to @card@ ng/mL . our assay be able to detect RBD IgG titer nearly four time lower those determine by Elisa , demonstrate relatively high sensitivity of our flow cytometry base anti-RBD IgG assay . in this study , we develop a sensitive surrogate neutralization assay use RBD-coupled MagPlex-C bead and biotinylated ACE2 protein . in a large interlaboratory study in which we have participate [ @card@ ] , this surrogate neutralization assay be able to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD neutralize antibody on blind test sample with very low serological antibody titer ( <31.0 ng/mL ) with which our anti-RBD and spike serological assay could not determine positivity ( one of the black diamond show in the negative region of the IgG assay plot in Figure 3 ) . the neutralization assay can further complement the serological anti-RBD IgG assay for enhanced assay sensitivity . furthermore , a good correlation between the NT50 determine via surrogate neutralization assay and anti-RBD IgG titer obtain from the quantitative serological RBD IgG assay be show in Figure 6 . the high the anti-RBD IgG titer , the large the NT50 , consistent with the presence of increase neutralize anti-RBD antibody in the sample . a similar correlation be also observe when compare result of ELISA-based surrogate neutralization assay and serological anti-RBD assay [ @card@ ] . we observe an outlier sample display exceedingly high NT50 and rather low anti-RBD IgG titer . further examination of this sample reveal a high anti-RBD IgM titer , suggest that the majority neutralize antibody in this sample be of the IgM isotype . these finding highlight the need for robust orthogonal assay to provide a more holistic understanding of seroprevalence and complex patient response to SARS-CoV-2 infection . the proof-of-concept approach towards quantitative serology demonstrate here will enable comparison and standardization of serology assay result from different commercial and laboratory develop assay . if anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal IgG also have a neutralization effect , it can serve as a benchmark for standardize various neutralization assay . we be currently work with commercial manufacturer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal IgG and other US government agency for the identification of suitable reference IgG preparation through an interlaboratory study . a full length spike protein and two RBD antigen be produce use DNA plasmids , VRC-SARS-CoV-2 S-2P-3C-His8-Strep2 × 2 , Ragon-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD(319-529)-3C-His8-SBP ) , and Kram-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD(319-541)-His6 , respectively [ @card@ ] . another SARS-CoV-2 S1 ( CFAR #100979 ) be obtain from NIBSC , Hertfordshire , UK . a sequence schematic of the four SARS-CoV-2 antigen relative to the NCBI full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [ 9 ] be provide in Figure 7 with difference in sequence note for each protein . spike protein for SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV be also make in the laboratory use DNA plasmids generously provide by Drs.

Biotinylation of the Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein be carry out use an EZ-Link Micro NHS-PEG4-Biotinylation Kit from Thermo Fisher ( Rockford , Il , USA ) . @card@ µL of biotinylated Ragon RBD protein at a concentration of @card@ mg/mL be add to a 1 × @card@ MagPlex-Avidin bead suspend in a @card@ µL of assay buffer ( PBS with 1 % BSA ) and incubate for @card@ min on a rotator at room temperature . the reaction vessel be place into a magnet separator to perform two wash with @card@ mL of a block buffer , PBS with @card@ % Tween @card@ , 1 % BSA and @card@ % sodium azide ( PBS-TBN ) . finally , the RBD coated MagPlex-Avidin bead be resuspended in @card@ mL of PBS-TBN and store at 2–8 °C in the dark . Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein be couple to both SeroMap and MagPlex-C bead use xMAP Antibody Coupling ( Abc ) Kit ( Luminex , TX , USA ) . Prior to coupling , @card@ × @card@ bead be wash twice use @card@ µL of the Abc kit activation buffer . after the wash step , bead be resuspended in @card@ µL activation buffer and activate use a @card@ µL of EDC ( 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl ] carbodiimide hydrochloride ) . this reaction be stabilize by add a @card@ µL of Sulfo-NHS ( N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ) and incubate at room temperature for @card@ min on a rotator protect from light . bead be then wash 3 time use @card@ µL of the activation buffer and resuspended in @card@ µL of the activation buffer contain 5 µg of RBD and incubate at room temperature for 2 hrs . on a rotator protect from light . the coated bead be wash 3 time use the kit wash buffer and store in 1 mL washing buffer at 2–8 °C until need . assessment of serology assay performance with Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD coated MagPlex-Avidin , SeroMap , and MagPlex-C bead be carry out use negative serum Nist SRM 909c , RBD Mab S562-109 spike in the serum SRM 909c , and NIBSC’s SRAS-CoV-2 positive plasma control ( @card@ ) . use the assay protocol describe below , the high signal-to-noise ratio at different RBD Mab S562-109 concentration and different dilution of NIBSC’s positive control in PBT buffer ( PBS with 1 % BSA and @card@ % Tween @card@ ) be the criterion for the final selection of the bead type for the serological assay development . as a second step of bead optimization upon the bead type finalization , different amount of RBD and spike antigen from 2 to @card@ µg of viral antigen be use in the coupling reaction to @card@ × @card@ microbeads . again , high signal-to-noise ratio of the assay perform use the same positive and negative control be the criterion for the final selection of the amount of viral antigen for the coupling reaction . Microbeads , e. g. , MagPlex-C bead , conjugate with either spike or RBD antigen be sonicated briefly and then combine follow by a buffer exchange from the storage buffer to an assay buffer use a magnetic separator . a microsphere stock suspension be make at a final concentration of @card@ beads/µL for each antigen coated bead in PBT buffer . on a 96-well plate , @card@ µL of the work stock suspension be aliquoted into each well and @card@ µL of diluted control , reference standard , or patient sample with various dilution be add to appropriate well of the plate . the plate be cover to protect it from light and incubate for @card@ min at room temperature on a plate shaker at ≈800 rpm . the plate be then place onto the magnetic separator and separation be allow to occur for 1 min . the supernatant be remove carefully by manual inversion . then , @card@ µL of wash buffer be add to each well , mix well , and then place onto the magnetic separator to remove supernatant . the washing step be repeat once more for a total of two wash . a @card@ µL of PE-labeled detection antibody , either 4 µg/mL of anti-IgG for IgG assay or @card@ µg/mL of anti-IgM for IgM assay , be add per well . the plate be cover to protect from light and incubate for @card@ min at room temperature on the plate shaker at ≈800 rpm . after two wash with wash buffer , the microsphere be again suspend in a @card@ µL of wash buffer . the microsphere be pipette up and down several time with a multichannel pipettor . sample be then analyze with 3000–5000 gat bead event per antigen coated microsphere on a CytoFLEX LX flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Palatine , Il , USA ) . in our assay , the convalescent patient sample be add to a sample well contain both RBD coated bead and spike coated bead with different fluorescence emission dye ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . this permit us to run duplex assay . the antibody bind to both bead be detect by either pe label anti-human IgG or anti-human IgM . each sample have two group of PE fluorescence signal , one group associate with the RBD bead , and the other group with spike bead . the two group of fluorescence signal provide a measure of the median fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) for the RBD and spike bead . a monoclonal IgG against SARS-CoV , Mab S562-109 ( RBD specific ) , be use as a reference IgG control for quantify IgG titer in patient sample because of its cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( private communication with Dr. Corbett at NIAID , NIH ) . a calibration curve be construct use different amount of Mab S562-109 spike in @card@ dilution of negative serum SRM 909c . the calibration curve of IgGRBD vs. MFI be generate use mAb S562-109 on microbeads couple with RBD , and subsequently fit to a logistic curve give by Equation ( 1 ) [ @card@ ] . ( 1)MFI=a×Concb+Conc where a give the limit MFI at large antibody concentration and b be the concentration at which MFI be equal to a/2 . the two parameter and their uncertainty be obtain from the covariance matrix calculate by a curve fitting program implement in Python . equation ( 1 ) can be invert to give expect IgG concentration value for a give MFI . it be assume that the equilibrium number of IgG on bead suspend in the patient sample be the same as the equilibrium number of IgG on bead suspend in a reference IgG solution . in that case , the inverted form of Equation ( 1 ) can be use to estimate the concentration of IgG in the sample give the MFI of bead incubate in the sample . the uncertainty of the concentration estimate can be obtain use uncertainty propagation in Equation ( 2 ) ( the inverted form of Equation ( 1 ) , ( 2)Conc=b×MFIa−MFI RBD coated bead ( 1 × @card@ µL per well ) be incubate with @card@ µL/well of\n",

( 4)Reduction %=max+min−max1+NT50dilutionn here , Max and min be parameter represent maximum and minimum response , respectively . NT50 be the neutralization antibody titer at which the response be @card@ % of the maximum ( @card@ % of the RBD site be occupy by Nab ) , and n determine how fast the transition from max to min occur .   Healthcare staff perception towards influenza and potential COVID-19 vaccination in the @card@ pandemic context Healthcare worker ( HCWs ) have a high risk of exposure to occupationally associate infectious disease [ 1 ] . vaccination of HCWs be encourage to reduce the risk of infection of hepatitis B , tuberculosis , and seasonal influenza [ [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ] . vaccination for seasonal influenza be see as particularly important not only to protect staff and patient , but also to ensure that seasonal workforce sickness rate do not compromise care . despite the importance of these programme there remain reluctance from some HCWs to receive vaccination for numerous reason , thus trigger research on how good to increase immunization rate in National Health Service ( NHS ) staff in the UK [ @card@ ] . in some setting mandatory influenza vaccination have be propose or implement [ 8 ] . in the Northern Hemisphere there be significant concern that seasonal influenza could co-circulate during surge of SARS-CoV-2 activity during the COVID-19 pandemic , place significant burden on healthcare service [ 9 ] . there be also a risk that co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza or other respiratory virus might increase morbidity and mortality [ @card@ ] . therefore a survey be conduct to understand the perception of HCWs towards receive routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the @card@ season , and to understand the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against the new COVID-19 context . the aim be also to understand staff perception towards receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 ahead of the introduction of these vaccine . this research will be relevant to future winter , as it be likely that influenza and COVID-19 will coexist . an electronic survey of staff member be conduct at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust ( UHCW ) , a 1250-bed major tertiary referral centre in the West Midlands region , employ just over @card@ full-time equivalent staff and provide a full spectrum of paediatric , obstetric , adult , neurosurgery , and trauma service . the centre go on to be the first globally to administer the first approve Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial . the survey be design to identify perception of healthcare worker towards receive routine seasonal influenza vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , as well as understand staff perception towards receive a COVID-19 vaccination in the future . the survey be live from September 2nd to 13th , @card@ . the survey be design by a multi-disciplinary collaboration of clinician and research and development staff , include a consultant virologist , consultant microbiologist and an infection prevention and control nurse . it be base on the previously publish survey at this organization on staff perception towards antibody testing , and it utilize a number of the same construct [ @card@ ] . the survey comprise a mixture of Likert-based response and binary response depend on question type , with @card@ question in all . the survey be develop use GoogleForms software and ethical approval be grant through the Trust’s COVID-19 ethic committee ( GAFREC Id : GF0416 ) . it be distribute electronically through a rolling advert on the intranet homepage alongside group e-mails to staff member . staff be advise that the survey be voluntary . the result be analyse use descriptive and semiquantitative method , with subdivision of result depend on staff role . in all , @card@ response be receive from the @card@ Trust HCWs , yield a response rate of @card@ % . response be receive from @card@ medical staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ nursing staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ administrative staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ allied health professional ( @card@ % ) , @card@ manager ( @card@ % ) , and @card@ healthcare assistant ( @card@ % ) . the mean duration of NHS employment for respondent be @card@ year . in response to the question ‘ How often do you get the annual influenza vaccine ? ' , @card@ staff ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccination every year without fail , while @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccine most year , @card@ ( @card@ % ) report they get an influenza vaccine some year , @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccine occasionally and @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they never get vaccinate . figure 1 report the relative importance that staff place on different motivation for get an annual influenza vaccine . table 1 record staff perception regard both influenza and potential COVID-19 vaccination , with the majority of staff identify the need to vaccinate in order to protect themselves , their family , and their patient as the drive reason to get vaccinate . a total of @card@ staff ( @card@ % ) report that if a fully approve COVID-19 vaccine become available , freely distribute through their employer , with appropriate safety and efficacy datum , they would be likely or very likely to get a vaccine . this be an electronically distribute survey with a relatively large number of response ( albeit low response rate ) despite the confine and challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic . the overall response to question regard influenza vaccination be encourage , with @card@ % of respondent identify the need to protect themselves , their family , and their patient , and suggest that they be likely to present themselves for vaccination . these response be consistent with the report that @card@ % of respondent get the influenza vaccine every year , and a further @card@ % most or some year . these @card@ % represent an important group to target and to understand motivation because they be clearly not anti-vaccination but be likely to get vaccinate when access be easy rather than to actively seek out vaccination . there be an important minority ( @card@ % ) who feel that influenza vaccination be less important for the @card@ season because they perceive that social distancing provide adequate protection . although influenza rate during the winter of @card@ have be very low , this may point to grow complacency in future year , despite the ongoing likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus will coexist [ @card@ ] . fortunately , a great number of HCWs ( @card@ % ) report that they be more likely to get an influenza vaccine this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic . the motivation for respondent to receive an influenza vaccination show important finding , despite substantial problem with staff healthcare service over the COVID-19 pandemic . reduce workplace absence be see as the least important reason to get an influenza vaccine . regard incentivization , opinion be divide , with @card@ % in favour of , and @card@ % against ; this be an area that need careful ethical consideration . a substantial proportion ( @card@ % ) feel that people not get an influenza vaccine should not receive sick pay if they be absent from work with influenza-like symptom . unfortunately , no datum be available from the pre-COVID-19 period to determine whether experience of staff absence due to COVID-19 have influence opinion . remarkably , around one-quarter feel that HCWs refuse COVID-19 vaccine who then have to self-isolate follow contact either at or outside work should not be pay . possibly this indicate a great personal responsibility during the pandemic , or a perception that influenza be less serious . despite the disruption cause by the COVID-19 pandemic , not all respondent report that they be likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine . however , easy access to vaccination be important , with only @card@ % be prepare to get a COVID-19 vaccine outside of their normal working hour , and @card@ % prepare to travel to another site . it will be important to retrospectively consider COVID-19 vaccine uptake rate once rollout have be complete , and to understand what feature drive the increase uptake across differ vaccination strategy throughout the NHS . there be relatively broad consensus that NHS staff should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination and even more so those in frontline patient-facing role . whereas it could be argue that it be not surprising that HCWs would see themselves as priority for vaccination , it be notable that a large proportion of non-frontline , non-patient-facing staff indicate that their frontline colleague should be prioritized . however , the vaccine rollout in the UK actually place social care staff and patient ahead of NHS staff [ @card@ ] . this study have a number of strength , include a relatively large sample size across the full range of HCW job type . we believe that our work provide a unique insight into HCW perception regard influenza and COVID-19 vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . there be , however , a number of limitation , include the single-centre nature of the study , and the fact that the study be perform before much information about the imminent COVID-19 vaccine be available . the survey be distribute to all staff member at the organization via e-mail and the intranet webpage , ensure that all staff have the opportunity to complete the survey ; however , we can be certain that the result be truly representative of HCW attitude , due to the rather low response rate . perhaps the main importance of this research be to lay foundation for important future study review the actual uptake of vaccination . it will be important to determine the reason give by HCWs for take up or decline influenza and/or COVID-19 vaccination . it will also be important to monitor ongoing perception of COVID-19 vaccination . particular focus be need around vaccine reticence among healthcare worker and ensure uptake across all demographic group . none . [ 5 ] . none declare .   restructure ENT out-patient service during the coronavirus disease @card@ pandemic – an iterative approach late January @card@ see the first case of coronavirus disease @card@ ( Covid-19 ) in the UK,1 with the global outbreak be identify as a pandemic by early March @card@ the swift , exponential rise in case and report death throughout March @card@ ultimately require the UK government to adopt a nationwide disease suppression strategy.3 sequential non-pharmaceutical intervention be rapidly introduce , to lower the reproduction number and significantly reduce viral transmission:4 self-isolation be follow by social distancing and school closure , public event be ban , and a country-wide lockdown be declared.5 despite these measure , the UK have report @card@ @card@ confirm case and @card@ @card@ death as of 10th June @card@ Covid-19 infection be cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2).7 it be highly contagious , spread more readily than influenza.8 the virus spread predominantly via small droplet originate from the upper respiratory tract during talk , cough or sneezing.8,9 Aerosol-generating procedure be think to pose a particular threat for healthcare workers.10 in part , infection severity be think to be directly relate to viral load exposure , with high viral load more likely to cause infection and more severe illness , as see in influenza.11 the virus remain viable on plastic and stainless steel for up to @card@ hours.12 Contaminated surface thus represent an additional , albeit subordinate , potential route of spread,8 but their consideration in healthcare setting be critical . on 17th March , National Health Service ( NHS ) trust be instruct to postpone all non-urgent elective activity in order to maximise capacity to deal with the anticipated wave of Covid-19 case , and to prevent the unnecessary exposure of non-infected individual during routine elective activity.13 consequently , advice be issue to convert non-urgent out-patient consultation into remotely conduct appointment where possible or , if not feasible , to postpone such activity.14 Face-to-face attendance be reserve for clinically urgent or emergency case only . management guideline be publish to minimise the exposure of healthcare worker and patient to Covid-19 ; @card@ these address personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and clarify new good practice . early report follow the Covid-19 outbreak in China highlight ENT surgery and ophthalmology as amongst the high risk specialty for medical staff to contract the infection.16 established respiratory virus pandemic relate guidance on infection control measure require to perform aerosol-generating procedure suggest that these procedure be conduct by the most experienced person , with minimum staff require , in a single room , whilst wear full PPE.17 however , the evidence base for this remain controversial.10 in Ent , particular attention have focus on identify which procedure should be class as aerosol-generating procedures,18 thus require level 3 PPE.9 these include : flexible nasendoscopy , oral examination , aural microsuction , nasal packing and nasal cautery . on 29th April @card@ , guidance be issue on how to re-establish elective service during the Covid-19 pandemic,19,20 whilst social distancing and stringent infection control requirement persist , and later updated.21 How to flexibly adapt service to ongoing change in guidance whilst ensure safe practice remain a continue challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic . here we report an iterative , four-cycle change in practice project , by which we restructure our ENT out-patient service to accommodate pandemic-related guidance in a data-driven manner . we conduct a prospective quality improvement project examine the ENT out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham . it encompass a literature review , four data collection cycle and two survey . a literature search of the PubMed and Cochrane database be conduct ( search 1 – ‘ COVID-19 ' , ‘ outpatient ' and ‘ Ent ' ; search 2 – ‘ COVID-19 ' and ‘ outpatient ' ; and search 3 – ‘ COVID-19 ' , ‘ outpatient ' and ‘ aerosol generating procedure ' ) . in addition , publish guideline from Public Health England , the Royal College of Surgeons of England and Ent UK be scrutinise for their relevance to out-patient clinic set-up need to incorporate aerosol-generating procedure during the Covid-19 pandemic . the paper identify via the literature search be screen for relevance by title . publication be exclude if they be unrelated to the organisation of out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic , or if they only contain non-specific infection control out-patient recommendation . the remain article be read in full to determine if they relate specifically to the organisation of out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic and encompass datum on the timing of aerosol-generating procedure , or specifically address the challenge of maintain patient flow in a department with a high volume of aerosol-generating procedure . the four quality improvement project cycle each last one week ( Figure 1 ) . initial analysis of the default Ent out-patient clinic set-up prompt consultation by the contribute author with senior out-patient nursing , medical and infection control staff , which initiate a change in practice to accommodate infection control relate issue surround aerosol-generating procedure ( recommendation in cycle 1 , Table 1 ) . datum be collect prospectively from 21st to 27th April @card@ ( cycle 1 ) to assess the adequacy of this new clinic set-up , and again from 1st to 7th May @card@ ( cycle 2 ) , 8th to 14th May @card@ ( cycle 3 ) , and 15th to 21st May @card@ ( cycle 4 ) . electronic patient record be use to clarify miss datum where require . datum collect include the number of in-person out-patient attendance , and the number of aerosol-generating procedure perform . from cycle 2 onwards , datum be collect on : the type of procedure perform ( all type with a frequency of three or less be group as ‘ miscellaneous ' ) , aerosol-generating procedure duration , and whether the procedure be perform in the emergency review clinic ( staff by junior doctor ) or a consultant-led clinic . room disinfection measure follow the performance of an aerosol-generating procedure be conduct accord to local hospital policy ; specifically , a rest period ( @card@ minute ) , which allow airborne particle to settle ( determine by the number of ventilate air change per hour per room ) , be follow by room disinfection ( @card@ minute ) . Two e-mail survey ( survey 1 and 2 ; Table 2 ) be send to senior out-patient nursing staff and all member of the ENT medical staff , to obtain feedback on the restructure clinic set-up ( 36-hour response window ) . the datum collection and survey result be disseminate to the survey staff via a socially distant governance meeting and e-mail ( outcome dissemination 1 and 2 ) , and later via a newly set up work group ( outcome dissemination 3 and 4 ) . new recommendation for further clinic restructuring ( recommendation in cycle 2–5 ) be develop and implement at the time of outcome dissemination , prior to further datum collection . Spearman 's rank correlation be use to evaluate correlation between in-person attendance and the number of procedure perform . pair t-tests be use to evaluate difference between mean timing accord to the type of procedure perform and the type of clinic that the procedure be perform in . statistical analysis be carry out use MatLab2019a . the literature search identify @card@ article , of which @card@ be exclude after screening by title . Seventeen article be identify as potentially relevant and scrutinise in full . of these , @card@ be exclude as they do not cover out-patient clinic set-up encompass aerosol-generating procedure during the Covid-19 pandemic . the remain two publication describe ENT clinic model incorporate aerosol-generating procedures.22,23 however , neither publication consider out-patient model base on datum that include aerosol-generating procedure duration , nor specifically address the challenge of maintain patient flow in a department carry out a high volume of aerosol-generating procedure . the iteration cycle perform during our study period include : four data collection episode , two survey , four point of outcome dissemination and five set of recommendation ( Figure 1 ) . throughout the study , in-person attendance increase four-fold between cycle 1 and cycle 4 , whilst the amount of aerosol-generating procedure perform rise by @card@ per cent ( Table 3 ) . out-patient attendance be greatest on Thursday in cycle 1 ( @card@ per cent of attendance ) , Wednesday in cycle 2 ( @card@ per cent ) , Wednesday in cycle 3 ( @card@ per cent ) and Thursday in cycle 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . Aerosol-generating procedure be most frequently perform on Thursday in cycle 1 ( @card@ per cent ) , Friday in cycle 2 ( @card@ per cent ) , Monday in cycle 3 ( @card@ per cent ) and Thursday in cycle 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . overall , there be a statistically significant correlation between in-person attendance and the number of procedure perform ( p < @card@ ) . Survey 1 have a @card@ per cent response rate ( @card@ out of @card@ , comprise 7 consultant , 4 middle-grade doctor , 6 senior house officer or foundation year doctor , and 1 senior nurse ) . of the respondent , @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have see patient in person during cycle 1 , and @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have access to PPE as recommend . One respondent could not access the power air-purifying respirator , require a colleague ( successfully fit-tested for a filter facepiece code 3 ( FFP3 ) mask ) to perform that aerosol-generating procedure . Seven of the @card@ respondent have problem find a room to perform an aerosol-generating procedure , all of whom identify day 3 ( Thursday ) in cycle 1 as the problem day . response to question 7 in survey 1 identify a lack of room availability for aerosol-generating procedure , with concern that this may become a great problem once elective activity resume ( eight respondent ) . answer to question 8 in survey 1 suggest that more aerosol-generating procedure room be need ( four respondent ) , with separate Covid-19 negative and positive area be maintain ( three respondent ) . complete response can be view in Appendix 1 . finding from the first data collection episode and the first survey be disseminate and discuss at our clinical governance meeting ( outcome dissemination 1 ) , from whence recommendation for further clinic restructuring ( recommendation in cycle 2 ) be compile ( Table 1 ) . of note , the first data collection episode and the first survey identify that cycle 1 , day 3 ( Thursday ) have be the most problematic , with the most attendance , the most aerosol-generating procedure and a report acute shortage of available room to perform aerosol-generating procedure . analysis of the attendance time identify that all patient require aerosol-generating procedure ( n = 5 ) have attend in the same 90-minute window , on a day when several parallel head and neck cancer clinic take place . follow consultation with departmental staff , five room be make available for aerosol-generating procedure ( instead of two ) , and ring-fenced as ‘ procedure room ' . the hot and cold room set-up for aerosol-generating procedure be abandon , as local infection control advice identify that all room use for aerosol-generating procedure require identical cleaning procedure irrespective of a patient 's Covid-19 status . the don room be also drop , as PPE can be don in the procedure room prior to perform an aerosol-generating procedure . it be identify that aerosol-generating procedure datum be need to enable appropriate forward planning . this be include in the recommendation for cycle 2 . subsequent recommendation be detail in Table 1 , include outcome status at the time of publication . overall , @card@ change in practice recommendation be make during cycle 1–4 , of which @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have be achieve , @card@ per cent ( 5 of @card@ ) have be partly achieve and @card@ per cent ( 8 of @card@ ) remain to be achieve at the time of writing . datum on aerosol-generating procedure duration be collect for @card@ per cent , @card@ per cent and @card@ per cent of aerosol-generating procedure in cycle 2 , cycle 3 and cycle 4 , respectively ( Table 4 ) . the reduction in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration between cycle 2 and cycle 4 be statistically significant ( p = @card@ ) ; however , no significant difference exist between cycle 2 and 3 ( p = @card@ ) , or between cycle 3 and 4 ( p = @card@ ) . the range of aerosol-generating procedure duration remain similar for the different cycle . table 5 show the overall number of aerosol-generating procedure accord to clinic type , for which timing have be record during cycle 2 , 3 and 4 . overall , datum on aerosol-generating procedure duration be collect for @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ per cent ) and @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ per cent ) of aerosol-generating procedure perform in the emergency clinic and consultant-led clinic , respectively . there be no statistically significant difference between the mean aerosol-generating procedure duration in the emergency clinic versus consultant-led clinic ( p = @card@ ) . table 6 depict the type of aerosol-generating procedure perform accord to procedure type , with no statistically significant difference in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration . Survey 2 have a @card@ per cent response rate ( @card@ out of @card@ , comprise 3 consultant , 7 middle-grade doctor , 5 senior house officer or foundation year doctor , and 1 senior nurse ) . of these , @card@ have see patient during the datum collection period . One of @card@ respondent have difficulty find a room in which to perform an aerosol-generating procedure . Free-text answer be outline in Appendix 2 . follow cycle 2 , we identify that @card@ per cent of junior doctor ( 9 of @card@ ) have fail fit-testing for FFP3 mask , thereby require a power air-purifying respirator in order to have adequate PPE . thus , subsequent recommendation include that power air-purifying respirator should be readily available in the ENT out-patient department ( Table 1 ) . during our study period , the number of ENT ring-fenced seat in the out-patient wait room be reduce from @card@ ( pre-pandemic ) to 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . at the end of cycle 4 , this be raise as a potential rate-limiting step , as footfall have start to increase , influence subsequent clinic template proposal . manage an out-patient department during the current Covid-19 pandemic pose new challenge , particularly in high-risk specialty such as otolaryngology,24 where aerosol-generating procedure be perform frequently . Covid-19 related guidance stress PPE requirement for aerosol-generating procedures,18,24,25 include how PPE should be don and doffed.26,27 however , most NHS Ent out-patient department be not set-up to easily accommodate infection control measure relate to respiratory pandemic . early recognition that safe performance of aerosol-generating procedure would pose a particular challenge for our out-patient service during this pandemic initiate the iterative change in practice approach report here . this enable rapid , data-driven restructuring of our out-patient set-up , ensure the safe performance of otherwise routine Ent procedure . To date , minimal literature report on out-patient service in the Covid-19 pandemic exist . Lal et al.28 produce recommendation for an orthopaedic out-patient department . they adjust their clinic set-up with respect to social distancing requirement , and publish a floor-plan and patient flow model . they estimate the likely maximum clinic capacity from clinician ' estimation of procedure duration,29 but do not report collect datum to support and refine these change . additionally , the orthopaedic clinic do not routinely perform large number of aerosol-generating procedure and , thus , plan for these do not form part of their work . our literature review identify that , to date , little specific evidence exist regard : the performance of aerosol-generating procedure , out-patient footfall , and the incorporation of infection control measure relate to Covid-19 within an ENT out-patient setting . of the two article identify as relevant , Weiss et al.23 describe change to the set-up of their out-patient Ent department , include the double triage of patient into ‘ hot ' and ‘ cold ' stream , to minimise room contamination . they integrate this into an ‘ operational concept ' and implement it within @card@ hour follow approval from infection control team . they allude to their ‘ operational concept ' have be produce by an iterative process , but do not publish the structure of this process , or evidence of cyclical datum collection , recommendation and feedback . in contrast , Lescanne et al.22 produce a stepwise guide to the re-organisation of ENT out-patient service , which include change to their triage area , wait area and reception area , to minimise contact between patient and staff . they identify that common ENT procedure would produce infectious aerosol , require stringent PPE and disinfection , but do not examine the unique space and time constraint pose by high volume of aerosol-generating procedure in an out-patient department . neither of these publish study report an iterative approach to out-patient clinic structure that be drive by recorded attendance and timing datum . overall , the iterative approach we use enable the formulation of @card@ recommendation during the study period . the majority of these have be achieve by the time of writing ( @card@ per cent ) , most within the cycle subsequent to the identification of the issue . our result demonstrate a four-fold increase in face-to-face attendance during the period study . this may reflect patient ' initial relative fear of attend hospital towards the beginning of lockdown , which have be subside as report of new Covid-19 infection and death abate . as expect , we find a statistically significant correlation between the number of in-person attendance and aerosol-generating procedure perform . whilst recent month have see an increase use of telemedicine and virtual clinic to accommodate elective out-patient activity , this may decrease as elective face-to-face service be resumed.19–21 particularly in Ent , where remote patient examination be challenging , out-patient department need to expect an ever-increase footfall and prepare to accommodate the grow number of associate aerosol-generating procedure . interestingly , our study highlight that different factor can limit the number of clinic attendance an Ent department will be able to accommodate . One rate-limiting step identify be the significantly reduce number of seat in our wait area because of distancing requirement ( 4 instead of @card@ seat ) . another be the finite number of procedure room available for perform aerosol-generating procedure ( n = 5 ) . our result also identify a mean aerosol-generating procedure duration of @card@ minute overall , which drop from a mean of @card@ minute ( in cycle 2 ) to a mean of @card@ minute ( in cycle 4 ) . this statistically significant reduction be highly unlikely to be relate to a sudden increase in clinician ' speed at perform the procedure . instead , we suggest it indicate a learn curve effect regarding don and doff PPE , as well as a more efficient use of procedure room for aerosol-generating procedure . contrastingly , no significant difference in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration be identify between nasoendoscopy , nasal packing and aural microsuction , indicate that the turn-around time for procedure room be similar irrespective of the nature of the aerosol-generating procedure perform . additionally , we find no statistically significant difference in aerosol-generating procedure duration in the emergency clinic versus consultant-led clinic . overall , our datum have enable a single timing figure to be use to plan all of the propose clinic template . follow aerosol-generating procedure , a procedure room must ‘ rest ' before it be safe to clean.9 this rest period be dependent on the number of air circulations.9 in our department , a procedure room require a 20-minute rest period , follow by a 20-minute disinfection period . consequently , our procedure room be ‘ occupied ' for a mean of @card@ minute ( equate to the mean aerosol-generating procedure length plus the rest period plus the disinfection period ) for every aerosol-generating procedure perform . this total ‘ room time ' directly determine the number of aerosol-generating procedure that can be perform in one procedure room per session , which will be significantly reduce compare to pre-pandemic session . additional factor may impose further restriction to patient throughput and will need to be assess individually for each department . Aerosol-generating procedure represent a unique challenge to ENT out-patient service during the coronavirus disease @card@ ( Covid-19 ) pandemicThis be the first report describe data-driven change to ENT out-patient service during a respiratory pandemicAnalysis of rate-limiting step enable development of a safe , workable , Covid-19 out-patient modelA multidisciplinary approach be paramount to ensure successful , rapid introduction of service changesIterative approach to practice change allow pandemic-related issue to be address swiftly and flexibly most clinician be familiar with the clinical audit cycle . a clinical audit 's critical feature be a comparison to publish well practice.29 whilst there be useful publish guiding principle for social distancing and clean in an out-patient setting,9,18,22,28,30 there be no replicable ‘ gold-standard ' model relate to aerosol-generating procedure within the out-patient setting during the Covid-19 pandemic . thus , our work do not fit the traditional definition of a clinical audit cycle . instead , early recognition that our clinic set-up would need to accommodate aerosol-generating procedure lead to initial clinic restructuring recommendation , which catalyse an ongoing , flexible and radical change in practice , underpin by an iterative approach . the Association of Qualitative Research describe the iterative approach as ‘ particularly useful for time-sensitive project where there be not scope for multiple round of research’.31 we posit that restructure our set-up early , and respond to issue as they arise , would enable us to remain abreast of ongoing change to practice guideline . our approach share some key concept find in the ‘ agile ' methodology common in current management doctrine,32 which stress a short-cycle process of implement change , follow by testing and rapid feedback to correct issue . Tolf et al.33 examine the application of agile concept to hospital management , report that agile approach be underpin by a capacity to flexibly respond to both organisational and environmental variability . the high degree of unpredictability frequently see in hospital setting allow the agile approach to be of great value for change hospital management process . we suggest that in volatile circumstance , such as the current pandemic , an agile approach also provide a highly constructive strategy with which to address clinical process in the face of rapid change . the Covid-19 pandemic have bring unprecedented change to healthcare system globally . in otolaryngology , aerosol-generating procedure comprise a common , necessary part of out-patient activity , pose a particular challenge during this pandemic . as elective out-patient work resume , every ENT department need to consider how to accommodate increase number of aerosol-generating procedure with minimum risk of infection for patient and staff . currently , no literature exist to directly address this challenge . our four-loop quality improvement project incorporate principle find in iterative approach common to agile model use in business . this allow real-time , creative adaptation of ENT out-patient service to introduce pandemic-related change . it enable early recognition that aerosol-generating procedure now take far longer to complete , which impact out-patient activity . it also allow us to accommodate a four-fold increase in footfall and related aerosol-generating procedure in our service . we recommend this methodology for situation where unexpected , rapid out-patient service adjustment be require . we suggest data collection start simply , follow the first out-patient restructuring activity . it should cover aspect such as out-patient footfall trend , room and wait area availability , and timing of possible rate-limiting step . the cyclically gather datum should then be assess in a multidisciplinary setting consist of relevant stake-holder . this facilitate a unified approach for subsequent practice adjustment . the whole process should continue until an optimum steady state of practice have be reach . our finding demonstrate a constructive , rapid and successful process with which to tackle pandemic-related service challenge , without breach the guiding principle that protect patient and staff .   a Health Rights Impact Assessment Guide for Artificial Intelligence Projects Artificial intelligence ( Ai ) be be hail by various actor , include United Nations agency , as have the potential to alleviate poverty , reduce inequality , and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs).1 many Ai project be promote as make important contribution to health care and to reduce global and national health inequity . however , one of the risk of AI-driven health project be that they can be singularly focus on one health problem and implement to resolve that one problem , without consideration of how a whole health system be need to enable any one “ solution ” to function in both the short and long term . health project that have not be design in participation with local people have a history of fail , and externally fund development project be especially vulnerable . in term of human right , such failing can be attribute to a lack of participation , an imbalance of power , and failure to observe the critically important role of key institution such as the health system in fulfill people’s health right . health project that fail can have negative consequence beyond their own failed mission , and they risk harm human right generally and the right to health specifically . equitable access to quality health care be dependent on a well-function health system ; and such a system be regard as the core institution through which the right to health can be fulfilled.2 if a new project weaken the health system , perhaps by attract a disproportionate number of health worker to it , or overload diagnostic or supply chain service , or draw finance away from other core service , then it be negatively affect state obligation to fulfill the right to health . these risk may be great where health system be weakest—usually in low- and middle-income country . this perspective argue that the way to mitigate these risk be to conduct a health right impact assessment prior to their implementation . it introduce a tool that enable a systematic process of health right assessment to take place . in @card@ , the World Health Organization ( who ) introduce a guideline on how to use digital technology to strengthen health systems.3 the guideline provide useful indicator for assess some of the impact of Ai on health system , but it fail to locate the centrality of health system to the fulfilment of the right to health . the guideline follow a resolution bring to the World Health Assembly in @card@ that recognize the value of digital technology ( include Ai ) and their capacity to advance universal health coverage and the SDGs.4 however , the guideline concede that enthusiasm for digital health have see many short-lived implementation , an overwhelming diversity of digital tool , and a limited understanding of their impact on health system and people’s well-being.5 it stress the need to evaluate the positive and negative impact of propose digital health technology and to ensure that such investment do not inappropriately divert resource from alternative , nondigital approach and thereby increase health inequities.6 the guideline advise that digital health technology should complement and enhance health system function , rather than replace the fundamental component need by health system , such as the health workforce , financing , leadership and governance , and access to essential medicines.7 it call for an assessment of the health system’s ability to absorb digital intervention and warn that new technology must not jeopardize the provision of quality nondigital service in place where digital technology can be deploy . it demonstrate the assessment of various application of health-related technology base on effectiveness , acceptability , feasibility , resource use , and “ gender , equity and human right . ” the guideline encourage technology developer to work with user and to think broadly about context both within and beyond the health system , as well as to consider whether a give digital health intervention will improve universal health coverage . although human right be include with the “ gender , equity and human right ” component for impact analysis , the specific indicator select to assess this component be limit to the technology’s impact on equity.8 but equity—important as it may be—is only one human right consideration . it be also necessary to examine other key principle of the right to health when assess health interventions.9 although the who guideline examine various component of a health system when the component be directly affect by the technology , it fail to systematically examine the whole health system to identify any less obvious , indirect impact of the propose new technology . in response , this paper present an expanded tool to help state and other actor undertake a right to health impact assessment prior to implement Ai project . the tool , inform by the who guideline , be a refinement of an early impact assessment tool of aid-funded health project in low-resource settings.10 it accommodate additional consideration necessary when Ai health project be under development . it explore possible impact , specifically on the right to health , move beyond the civil and political right most frequently associate with digital health , big datum , and AI—namely , data privacy and protection , security , and algorithm transparency . it be a guide that provide a sample of the type of question across the health system that need to be explored—but each project will need its own context-specific adjustment . because the health system be the core institution through which the right to health can be realize , government and other agency have a duty to ensure that health system be enable to fulfill people’s entitlement to available , accessible , acceptable , and quality health service ( AAAQ).11 accordingly , government have a human right obligation to ensure that health system be never weaken but rather continually improve as part of their progressive realization duty , as detailed in General Comment @card@ of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights.12 One way to prevent a weakening of the health system while demonstrate a commitment to the progressive realization of the right to health be to carry out human right impact assessment prior to adopt and implement policy and programs.13 this apply to project relate to digital health , project drive by Ai ( irrespective of whether they be government or nonstate initiative ) , and project drive by local funding or through international assistance and cooperation . in order to conduct a health right impact assessment on a health system , it be convenient to compartmentalize the system to enable impact to be measure across its many function . a useful schematic devise by who identify the component part that contribute to the delivery of health care : health service and facility ; health worker ; health financing ; medicine , product , and other supply ; health information system ; and management and governance.14 importantly , there be more to a health system than these technocratic element : people and community must also be include , as the right to health entitle them to participate in a meaningful way in the planning , delivery , and monitor of health care and health promotion . human rights-based approach to health care and health project promote the active engagement of people who will be use service , as well as the understanding that people be legally entitle to these service as a function of their right to health . without people’s participation , health service can achieve AAAQ for all . a health right impact assessment be a systematic examination of a project , undertake prior to its implementation , to anticipate the effect that it will have on human right and health , include and extend beyond its own project-related goal . it should not be confuse with , nor replace by , a need assessment , which be a narrow exercise that do not assess risk . a health right impact assessment predict immediate and longer-term impact on the whole health system by examine each of the system’s component part and assess the way in which the project could strengthen or weaken that component . if risk be identify , an impact assessment consider way to mitigate them . the purpose of such an assessment be at least twofold : it aim to strengthen the project by ensure that it be in alignment with the health system and its govern strategy and plan ; and it aim to strengthen the health system by help design project that will be sustainable and contribute to the protection and fulfilment of health rights.15 conduct a health right impact assessment when a project be be design can help government adopt and implement policy , program , and project that will well meet their obligation to take deliberate and concrete step toward the progressive realization of human rights.16 it serve a further purpose as well , by promote engagement with the key feature of the right to health , outline in Table @card@ even before the extraordinary pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic , health system worldwide be face challenge , include great demand for service with the rise burden of disease , increase cost , and poor productivity and overstretched human resource . it would therefore be of great benefit to health system and community if technological advance could help reduce burden on system and health care cost while increase accessibility and equity.18 in an opening address to the “ Ai for Good Summit ” in @card@ , the secretary-general of the International Telecommunications Union , Houlin Zhao , urge the audience to “ turn [ the ] data revolution into a development revolution . ” @card@ To achieve this revolution , though , it be imperative that the development context be fully understand and reflect in the datum solution . Development have a long history of failed project , especially those dependent on technology.20 enthusiastic donor can be persuasive partner when seek to test new technology in low-resource setting , and government in these setting be presently indicate that they be “ open for business ” when it come to Ai partnerships.21 not only be the well-known pitfall arise from a lack of ongoing technical or health worker support , or funding for maintenance , present with AI-based technology partnership , but additional traps as yet unknown can arise from downstream datum ownership , share , and reuse.22 Ai be be use in health care in various way , include in diagnosis ( especially image ) , patient management , treatment ( for example , robotic in surgery ) , and new drug development.23 in the wake of COVID-19 , technology be also play a large part in contact tracing , where it monitor the spread of the epidemic , and in the race to develop a vaccine.24 but many of these use demand a level of technical capacity well beyond that available to health system in low-resource setting . even if the technology be design elsewhere and import , its ongoing use require an adequate , well-trained , and available workforce ; infrastructure ( include , at the very least , electricity and Internet ) ; and accessible health facility so that the benefit of such advance be equitably available to all people . design data-driven technological project for health care in low-resource setting require a detailed understanding of their challenging context ; otherwise , the intervention will almost certainly be inappropriate or unsustainable . it be difficult to acquire such an understanding from afar . but even locally develop AI-based technological solution can fail to respect and protect human right if they be not support the local health system in meet the health right of the people in its jurisdiction.25 thus , regardless of whether Ai health project be be introduce in a development context ( a focus of Ai for Good ) or in high-income country , it be imperative that systematic health right impact assessment be undertake and that they be broad enough to anticipate impact on the health system component , as well as on civil and political right relate to datum privacy , ownership , and security . present in Table 2 , this assessment tool be frame to guide the development of Ai for health project that comply with a right to health framework in local context . each of the propose question be link to at least one of the key feature of the right to health . therefore , indicator be select to assess impact on the health system and on the right to health . this perspective have present a rationale for undertake a right to health impact assessment before implement Ai health project in high- or low-resource setting . such assessment be in keep with the United Nations ' draft business and human right instrument to regulate the activity of business and transnational corporations.26 the tool in Table 2 demonstrate the range of question that need to be address before implement Ai project to determine how a new technology might affect the health system and , therefore , the right to health . introduce an app that can , for example , diagnose skin cancer or detect a pregnant person’s increase risk of pre-term birth , do nothing to fulfill people’s right to health entitlement , or universal health coverage , if there be no suitable treatment available for skin cancer or secondary-level obstetric service accessible to those who need them . every component of the health system must be function well before a service can become equitably available , accessible , acceptable , and of good quality ; and if these and other right to health feature be not achieve , people’s right can be fulfill . this tool include question that not only probe the technocratic aspect of the health system—even though they be crucially important—but also assess other key right to health principle , include participation , accountability , equality and nondiscrimination , non-retrogression , and international cooperation . it be not enough for developer of a new Ai application to claim that their application will address one health service and will therefore “ help achieve SDG3 and universal health coverage ” ; without a right to health impact assessment , there can be no confidence that this be a likely outcome . similarly , all human right be interrelate and indivisible , which mean that a rights-based App assessment must look beyond the health sector to determine how the technology could also affect other right , include those relate to privacy , confidentiality , and security . the long-term sustainability of a technology-based business depend not only on state ' and business ' fulfillment of their obligation to protect human right but also on the development of product that service provider find useful , affordable , efficient , and acceptable to right holder , include man , woman , and child . these criterion apply whether the technology be state or nonstate own and develop . this work be support by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council ( grant number ES/M010236/1 ) .   impact of pandemic on mental health in lower- and middle-income country ( LMICs ) Globally , the COVID-19 pandemic have aggravate poverty and result in mental illness . this nexus of rise mental illness in low resource context and increase extreme poverty in lower- and middle-income country ( LMICs ) in the context of the global pandemic be now blatantly visible . these trend have not only exacerbate extreme poverty , but have also induce psychological distress and ill-health , thus significantly affect general mental health function of people across the globe . we ask for urgent action in develop policy that address poor mental health , which emanate from material deprivation and be currently intensify by the prevailing pandemic . our commentary highlight linkage between incidence of poverty and the rise of mental illness globally in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . mental ill-health and poverty be closely link in a complex negative cycle . it have be find that except for disease such as schizophrenia , where the genetic factor could be a dominant factor , extreme material deprivation result from the lack of gainful employment , inadequate nutrition , and lack of basic amenity could precede mental illness ( Patel et al . , @card@ ) . people affect by material deprivation be know to be at a high risk of mental illness ( World Health Organization , @card@ ) . extreme poverty , measure as earn less than USD @card@ a day by the World Bank , be accompany by hunger , overcrowd live condition , low accessibility and affordability of health service , limited educational and livelihood opportunity , and adverse life event associate with socioeconomic vulnerability . the culmination of these factor be know to increase risk of mental distress and mental illness ( Lund et al . , @card@ ) . over time an awareness in the field of mental health recognize that this vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill health need to be view from human right perspective . in addition , the focus on poverty alleviation within health science need a good alignment with the global development agenda ( Patel et al . , @card@ ; Kumar , @card@ ) . in general , people live in poverty also experience a low quality of life and exhibit low well-being indicator , such as poor health , social and physical security , and political freedom and choice . poverty increase the risk of mental illness that consequentially increase the likelihood of economic downturn at individual and family level ( World Health Organization , @card@ ) . individual with mental illness be stigmatize , actively discriminate against , and their ability to hold livelihood and access opportunity be reduce . the cost associate with mental health treatment also increase economic burden on the individual and the family ( Patel et al . , @card@ ) . this indicate that live with mental illness over time can also make one poor . before COVID-19 , one out of four people suffer from mental ill-health ( primarily anxiety and depression ) . now as approximately 3–4 billion people be place in lockdown as a mitigation response measure to COVID-19 , more and more people be suffer from anxiety . people be under acute stress stem from job loss , COVID-19-related death ( within family and friend ) , and abnormal situation associate with restriction of movement and social isolation . in addition , a large number of individual experience stress and anxiety from suspected exposure to COVID-19 and from be quarantine away from the secure confine of their home in LMICs . COVID-19 be merely one symptom of the dysfunctional relationship between human and nature , which be manifest through climate change , loss of biodiversity , habitat fragmentation , and domestication of wild animal ( UNEP , @card@ ) . in @card@ , the United Nations Environment Programme flag the worldwide increase in zoonotic epidemic . around @card@ % of all infectious disease in human be zoonotic , and the emergence of zoonotic disease be closely link with the deplete health of ecosystem ( UNEP , @card@ ) . there be emerge evidence from study in Wuhan , China , where the first lockdown be initiate as a measure to prepare for effective response to COVID-19 , that indicate that the lockdown in itself have severely impact the mental health of the Chinese people . Fu et al . ( @card@ ) report in a nationwide cross-sectional study that ease of the lockdown in the city be explicitly associate with stressful impact on a sizeable number of participant ( Ma et al . , @card@ ) . measure such as quarantine , isolation , and social distancing have seriously impact the mental health and general life of the people in China . expert have arrive at the consensus that these measure have trigger a wide variety of psychological disorder , such as panic disorder , anxiety , and depression in the general population ( Qiu et al . , @card@ ) . the result of a Chinese study review the effect of COVID-19 mitigation plan on mental health lead Wuhan 's government official to develop a multi-layered response that involve form psychological intervention team for key population that be likely to be impact by exposure to COVID-19 and its adverse risk factor ( Kang et al . , @card@ ) . these initial study from China have highlight the need to address vulnerable population , improve psychosocial and medical care access , ramp up disaster preparedness and mitigation , and strengthen health system , disaster management and intervention ( Qiu et al . , @card@ ) . public health emergency impact both individual and community . there be short- and long-term consequence for mental health and wellbeing , as witness in the post-epidemic phase of Ebola , SARS , and MERS ( Galea et al . , @card@ ) . during epidemic , in addition to a large number of the population suffering from depression and anxiety , surge in maladaptive high-risk behavior also increase , such as domestic violence and interpersonal conflict . issue surround fear , panic , and discrimination be be report ( Usher et al . , @card@ ) and be cover daily in news and social medium . opportunity to monitor psychosocial need and deliver intervention support during direct patient encounter in clinical practice be curtail in this crisis by large-scale home confinement ( Pfefferbaum and North , @card@ ) . it be estimate that the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in the general population range from 4 % to @card@ % and the prevalence of major depression will increase by 7 % after the outbreak ( Torales et al . , @card@ ) . the pandemic may worsen exist mental health problem and lead to more case among child and adolescent . this be due to the unique combination of the public health crisis , social isolation , disruption of education , limited peer interaction , boredom , and economic recession . all of these factor negatively impact wellbeing ( Golberstein et al . , @card@ ) . for those with exist and underlie health condition , these worry be further exacerbate due to the mass quarantine ( Rubin and Wessely , @card@ ) . give that globally @card@ million people have be infect , out of which approximately more than 1 million death have be record as of 7 October @card@ ( World Health Organization , 2020a ) , we know that the mental health need of individual who be infect and those who have recently recover may be significantly high . the\n",
            "isolation and loneliness around palliative care of those who succumb to the illness also mean that the family of these individual experience painful bereavement and traumatic grief . in many part of the world , relative and family member be stigmatize and force into quarantine . such measure be on the verge of become human right violation ( World Health Organization , 2020b ) and effort be need to uphold right and civil liberty . consequence of COVID-19 lockdown and mitigation effort have exacerbate the existing incidence of poverty and inequality among and within country . recently , the World Bank project that roughly @card@ million of the world 's population will be push into extreme poverty , assume that the COVID-19 pandemic do not change inequality within country or that the nation 's growth accumulate equally to everyone . Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia be anticipate to be the hard hit region , with @card@ million and @card@ million of the people in each region , respectively , project to be live on USD @card@ or less a day ( Gerzon et al . , @card@ ) . alongside monetary poverty , there be also acute multidimensional poverty , in which household be deprive of one-third or more of the @card@ indicator of health , education , and live standard set by the Sustainable Development Goals . the global multidimensional Poverty Index estimate that the 2 % ( or @card@ million ) of the world 's population , out of the @card@ million poor people , experience severe acute multidimensional poverty and another @card@ % ( or @card@ million people ) have not reach , but be vulnerable to acute multidimensional poverty ( UNDP , @card@ ) . the indicator of multidimensional poverty be when a household have a malnourished member , high child mortality , none in the family have complete 6 year of education , child do not attend school , clean drinking water be lack , nourish food be lack , improve sanitation be lack , and adequate safe housing be also lack . people experience acute multidimensional poverty be at extremely high-risk for COVID-19 and be often unable to comply with the preventative measure of social isolation ( UNDP , @card@ ) . this estimated projection of increase in monetary global poverty ( USD 5.5/day ) mean that any progress in eliminate extreme poverty would be set back by at least @card@ year ( World Bank , 2020a , b ) . the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of poverty be obvious and encompass . the world be experience a decline in gross domestic product between 4 % and 8 % in @card@ ( International Monetary Fund , @card@ ) . the restriction on movement of people , logistic bottleneck emanate from the lockdown , and in large case , the closure of production unit as a safety and health response have severely compromise the ability of the people to supply labor and earn wage . the impact be apparent in the extreme and marginal poor ( less than USD @card@ a day ) living in LMICs . for example , due to COVID-19 , sub-Saharan Africa would see a rise in people live under extreme poverty to @card@ million ( @card@ % ) by @card@ against the pre-COVID-19 estimate of @card@ % ( World Bank , 2020a , b ) . in general in LMICs , the hard-hit sector have a high proportion of informal worker and with limited access to health service and social protection . without appropriate policy measure , such worker risk fall into extreme poverty and will experience challenge in regain livelihood during the recovery period . in a recent COVID-19 mental health impact survey conduct by the who , result indicate the pandemic have disrupt or halt critical mental health service in @card@ % of country worldwide while the demand for mental health be increase ( World Health Organization , 2020c ) . we know that COVID-19 be strain the capacity of public health and essential service across the world . there be worry that the LMICs will be severely affect because investment in adequate staffing , health equipment , access to health service , and evidence-based guideline and their timely dissemination and coordinate implementation continue to be a challenge . Non-COVID-19 patient would suffer as much as those in need of serious medical intervention . recommended intervention for COVID-19 involve ( 1 ) the assessment of the accuracy of information , ( 2 ) enhance social support , ( 3 ) reduce the stigma associate with the disease , ( 4 ) maintain a normal life while adhere to safety measure , and ( 5 ) use psychosocial service , particularly online service , when need ( Rajkumar , @card@ ) . most of these response be compromise in under-resourced setting where health system can cope with preventive and promotive message and support . the treatment burden be in itself so significant that prevention and ancillary support service can be rally in a timely manner . those most affect in this pandemic be vulnerable low wage earn individual who also have underlie chronic condition . this be worsen if they also belong to vulnerable group , such as elderly , migrant worker , marginalize ethnic or racial group , woman , pregnant woman , and individual with mental illness . in such case , access to service and available support be also compromise ( Pfefferbaum and North , @card@ ; Rajkumar , @card@ ) . force quarantine and mark of informal settlement and locality as ‘ red zone ' due to COVID-19 exposure border human and mental health right violation . isolating people without adequate provision of their everyday life need can aggravate people 's stress and helplessness ( Rubin and Wessely , @card@ ; Torales et al . , @card@ ) . infectious disease bring with them heighten fear of contagion , stigma , and social ostracization of individual and community , as be see during HIV , Ebola , and related epidemic . there be existing evidence that poor mental health can be a cause and a consequence of poverty and destitution ( Lund et al . , @card@ ; Funk et al . , @card@ ) . common mental health disorder affect the wage-earning capacity of the poor as the individual 's everyday functioning be reduce ( Kleinman , @card@ ) . challenge mental health condition also reduce the wage earn potential of individual because of low employability . the absolute material deprivation can also cause depression , anxiety , or traumatic stress . we know that absolute poverty in many part of the world can be intergenerational . pandemic further hinder the capability of the poor to climb out of extreme poverty . even though mental health disorder affect 1 billion people globally , the government of the world spend only about 2 % of their health budget on address this issue . additionally , most people lack access to basic psychosocial and psychiatric treatment . the interconnection between poverty and mental health stop short of examine the health and care infrastructure and ignore the political factor that perpetuate an increase in both ( Patterson et al . , @card@ ) . the International Monetary Fund suggest that the world 's economy be project to contract by up to 8 % in @card@ , which be bad than the 2008–09 financial crisis ( IMF , @card@ ) . the emerge market and develop economy be project to contract by 1 % in @card@ . on employment , the International Labour Organization forecast that around @card@ billion worker be affect due to lockdown ( @card@ % of the world 's workforce ) ( International Labour Organization , @card@ ) . by now , several global agency and think tank have conclusively show that worker who be either extremely poor ( less than USD @card@ a day ) or poor would be hit the hard . this include refugee , migrant worker , non-farm laborer , and workforce engage through other informal activity . although government have respond promptly with relief package to keep their economy on life support and to maintain economic activity , informal worker ( about 2 billion ) be not benefit from these relief package . informal labor have @card@ % of total labor share in low-income country , @card@ % in lower-middle country , @card@ % upper-middle country , and @card@ % in high-income country . the University of Oxford 's COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index place India , Pakistan , Nigeria , and Brazil at high risk of their people fall into poverty due to their high share of the workforce operate within the informal economy ( Hale et al . , @card@ ) . poverty affect child disproportionately . One out of five child life in extreme poverty and ensure social protection for child and other vulnerable group be critical . progress in reduce working poverty have slow over the past 5 year and effort need to be reinvigorate ( United Nations , @card@ ) . the situation remain particularly alarming in sub-Saharan Africa , where the proportion of work poor have reach @card@ % in @card@ . in the least developed and landlocked develop country , at least one-quarter of worker live in extreme poverty despite have a job . employ young people ( between @card@ and @card@ year of age ) be more likely to be live in poverty , with a work poverty rate that be double than that of adult worker . the world be already struggle to achieve the target for poverty alleviation set under the globally agree agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals . conclusively , element of mental health condition determine the material condition of the affected individual who will be unable to sustain life and livelihood . in the context of a global pandemic , prevail institution and governance structure have prove to be a hindrance to the poor in the attainment of minimum material condition , thus make them increasingly vulnerable , marginalize , and sometimes even exclude from social protective net . the condition of extreme deprivation make marginalize and weak population psychologically fragile and vulnerable . a large number of poor population in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have co-morbid health condition , such as HIV , tuberculosis , cancer , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease , all of which have severe impact on emotional and physical capability that lead to a compromise psychological functioning . our commentary underscore how the world be materially deprive be severely impact due to this pandemic and the impact will likely continue beyond @card@ . the impact of COVID-19 on mental health will also hinge on the economic downturn . public mental health intervention should be formally integrate into public health preparedness and emergency response plan so that the poor and vulnerable population can be protect from spiral into an abject material condition . To break this nexus , a concerted effort to tackle mental health as a sizeable portion of overall health response be the need of the hour . the UN Secretary-General perceptively reiterate the slogan ‘ no health without mental health ' , which should be the core mandate of global development agenda ( time , @card@ ) . the mental health impact associate with COVID-19 need to be assess , quantify , and a proper response strategy need to be design in a nuanced and structured manner . the issue of mental health in poor part of the world be not well understand , and typically the remedy be also stigmatize and intervention inadequately resourced .   identification of superspreading environment under COVID-19 through human mobility datum in medical science , epidemiologist call someone who infect an especially large number of other people “ superspreaders”1 . the existence of superspreaders be notable as they can accelerate the rate of new infection in a pandemic . with COVID-19 declare a global pandemic by the World Health Organization ( who ) on March @card@ , @card@ , scientist have closely monitor and continuously update estimate of the effective reproduction number ( Rt ) , “ which represent the mean number of secondary infection that result from a primary case of infection at time t”2 . such research be necessary because Rt be an indicator of the transmission potential of a disease . a pandemic signal a decline trend only when Rt be below one . more case be expect when Rt exceed one . the high the value of Rt , the faster the transmission and the more alarming the public health risk . Rt for COVID-19 be estimate to be between two and three in early @card@ , but recent research suggest a high number in the range of @card@ to @card@ . yet , there be great inter-personal variability of disease transmission with much high transmissibility risk of a primary case by a superspreader5,6 . a superspreader in Wuhan infect @card@ healthcare worker that result in one death while an individual in Chicago who attend a dinner , a funeral and a birthday party be responsible for @card@ new infections1 . hence , research on identify , trace and treat superspreaders be highly important to pandemic control . thus far , the focus of research on superspreaders have primarily be aspatial1,6,7 . in this paper , we propose to broaden research on superspreaders through geographical model of the pandemic spread8 . figure 1 be an illustration use a hypothetical example of a city with @card@ sub-divisions/zones and with each zone carry a population of @card@ . Two scenario of spatial spread could result , assume that @card@ % of all infected case be cause by superspreaders1 , and the transmission rate of super versus non-super spreader be model at ten and two respectively ; where these value may be adjust accord to update and realistic estimate gather from field datum . Scenario A assume the presence of a superspreader in a non-superspreading environment whereas the superspreader in scenario B exist in a superspreading environment . with infectivity yield similar number of newly infect case at each time period , the spatial pattern of infection for the two scenario look very different because of the geographical setting populate by people at two extreme end of mobility . a non-superspreading environment ( Scenario A ) be characterise by people at the low end of mobility while a superspreading environment ( Scenario B ) have highly mobile individual , include long-distance commuter and those who regularly travel from place to place beyond their local community . we argue that a community/district with mobile population must also possess certain amenity or service to turn it into a superspreading environment . this be analogous to Losch modify Christaller’s central place theory9 , which suggest the location of retail in urban area attract people/consumers to purchase good and service they need ( see Supplemental Methods S1.1 ) . moreover , retail location in urban versus rural district exhibit different retail centrality , which be a measure of the retail drawing power or attraction of a give location10 . the density of street or transport network also play an important role in shape variation of retail and service intensity within a city11,12 . compare with suburban location , urban core or central business district where both high- and low-order retail and transport facility tend to cluster favour the formation of “ attractor ” in the settlement layout , exert a strong pull on consumer live nearby and further away in the region . consequently , the combined characteristic of high spatial agglomeration of retail activity and expanse transportation can serve as a proxy for superspreading environment . consider the vary spatial pattern of disease transmission under a superspreading environment , we suggest that non-pharmaceutical intervention ( NPIs ) for disease containment must step beyond the conventional practice of focus on home and workplace of the infected . unlike the traditional spatial analysis that associate patient to their home locations13–15 , this study identify candidate area with a heavy concentration of retail and public facility as potential spread environment . our approach aim to predefine high-risk area of disease spread such that these location can be target to receive more stringent and timely disease prevention and control measure before or during an outbreak . research on pandemic control have involve scientific study about the host , pathogen and the environment . under COVID-19 , scientific research on the pathogen ( such as the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ) have be ongoing at full steam although effective drug and vaccine to protect human being be still be test . it be also note that a period of at least two day of pre-symptomatic transmission in the community be particularly challenging2 . without an effective means of track asymptomatic individual , NPIs be essential component in public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic . there be recent evidence to suggest that NPIs have be effective in China and beyond2,16,17 . specifically , the COVID-19 case in China could be @card@ time high without NPIs2,18 . notwithstanding that these study have bundle all confinement or lockdown measure as NPIs , they recognize that the effectiveness of different intervention might vary . it be also realise that the economic and social cost of lockdowns can be enormous19 , as people be confine to home without be allow to participate in social , entertainment and leisure activity good for their physical and/or mental health . know that a complete city lockdown incur enormous economic and social cost , as well as related knock-on effect on physical/mental health and interpersonal violence , it may be beneficial to continue operation of some public facility deem important for maintain people’s daily life and wellbeing . study have suggest that permit limited access to sport centre , library , din out , and shopping for local resident can be manage with proper disease prevention measure , such as frequent disinfection , mandatory face-masks and physical distancing20,21 . under COVID-19 , these public facility have often be target for indiscriminate and complete close-down . refer to NPIs include in the Oxford database22 , close of these public facility may be consider as the intermediate step follow school and workplace closure , but before the most drastic measure of stay home order and complete city lockdown . this paper extend beyond current research that focus on the pathogen ( e. g. characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 ) or individual ( i. e. the host ) with a high risk to be superspreaders . it do not focus on biological characteristic of infected person ( e. g. in relation to their immune system ) but to examine the environment/space pose different health risk of a transmissible disease . it , therefore , supplement the traditional public health concern of medical science and microbiology with the spatial dimension of people-environment dynamics . against this background , this research use geospatial statistical method , originate from time geography23 , to differentiate between exceptionally “ high-risk superspreading facility ” cover wide spatial catchment area that attract user from distant location and those spend substantial period of time out-of-home , and “ local facility of the same type ” but with small spatial catchment area that mainly attract local resident and those spending short out-of-home time . first , we introduce the space–time concept and a method of identify high-risk public facility that may give rise to a superspreading environment due not only to the physical location ( e. g. near the central business district ) or the nature of facility ( e. g. being bar or shopping centre ) but also the characteristic of user ( e. g. whether they travel from a wide spatial catchment area and spend substantial out-of-home time with other user have similar lifestyle ) . even for the same type of facility like bar , some bar may be more local “ watering hole ” ( correspond more to scenario a in Fig . 1 ) while other can attract people from all over the city to hang out and socialize ( resemble more to scenario B in Fig . 1 ) . we make use of time and space information on the mobility pattern of individual in a city to aggregate the activity space ( AS ) , space–time prism ( STP ) , and the potential path area or potential risk surface for different type of activity ( see Supplemental Methods S1.4–S1.6 ) associate with the select public facilities27 . as illustrate in the leave panel of Fig . 2 , an individual’s recollection of place of visit within a day ( include home , all activity location and transit stop ) can be use to delineate a Standard Deviational Ellipse ( SDE ) which be use as the metric of his/her as ( see Supplemental Methods S1.4 ) . for measure mobility , we use the 2-dimensional rectangular area bound the AS and multiply it by the time factor . this measure of STP be a proxy for how far ( space ) and how long ( time ) an individual have take part in out-of-home activity during a day28 . the AS and corresponding STP for all individual who visit any of the six type of public facility record in the TCS database be calculate . we establish two hypothesis in relation to the different mobility characteristic of facility user . H1 : geographical agglomeration of the same type of facility tend to attract user of high mobility , as represent by large total STP . H2 : facility in the core urban area tend to be use by user with high total STP . To test the two hypothesis , the geographical agglomeration level ( low vs. high ) and the geographical location ( urban vs. suburb/new town ) of each public facility be analyse . Difference-of-means test be use to see whether the difference of AS and total STP of their respective user be statistically significant at p = @card@ . base on the six major type of public facility ( i. e. bar , shopping centre , karaoke & cinema , mega shopping mall , public library , and sport centre ) and catchment area of user with a highly mobile lifestyle , we ask whether these combination could be classify into different class of “ potential spatial risk ( PSR ) ” to differentiate superspreading environment ( see right panel of Fig . 2 ) . with spatial agglomeration ( high vs. low facility density and urban vs. suburb AS ) as the x-axis and user ' total STP ( high vs. low ) as the y-axis , each facility of the same type be assign into one of the four quadrant to indicate their PSR class ( see Group A and Group B table in the right panel of Fig . 2 ) . if the above two hypothesis hold true which suggest agglomeration as a risk factor , the high-high quadrant present the high PSR in create a superspreading environment ( red quadrant in Group A , Fig . 2 ) . however , some location with few establishment ( i. e. a lack of agglomeration or H1 be reject ) that be frequent by highly mobile individual ( i. e. H2 hold true ) may also be candidate of a superspreading environment ( red quadrant in Group B , Fig . 2 ) . class 2 PSR with high population density ( orange section for both group A & B in Fig . 2 ) signal potential location of localized outbreak because of low STP . the number of PSR class will be determine base on the datum construct . our example use two class ( low vs. high ) on each dimension to yield four quadrant in total ( with the low-low quadrant split by high and low population density ) . To reflect the superspreader characteristic of much high risk and transmission rate , we weigh the different PSR class exponentially with a base of ten to standardise and differentiate risk level . finally , the risk surface of all six public facility be integrate to produce a “ risk map of superspreading environment ” ( hereafter refer to as the “ SE-risk map ” ) for the entire city . the method can be adopt in other city with reasonably well-established datum on travel activity and public facility . the CHP host a map-centric dashboard show key information about the pandemic , with daily update ( https : //chp-dashboard . geodata . Gov . hk/covid-19/en . html ) . each case of confirm and suspect COVID-19 infection get a unique case number , with the corresponding home location indicate . the CHP and various group of scientific researcher have track infected individual and identify different “ cluster ” of COVID-19 case . at least @card@ cluster have be identify as at July @card@ , @card@ and Supplemental Table S1 list the ten large cluster . the top-ranked “ bar and music band ” cluster not only be the large so far but also among the early in affect the city . we choose to focus on these cluster and attempt to obtain more detail about the infected case from news medium and press release from the government . many of the recount of movement and activity by infected individual be incomplete due to memory lapse and possible editing/word limitation set by local news medium . the sequence of visit different location be often available from news report but the exact duration of each activity be not available . we could thus compute only the AS ( but not total STP ) in the validation analysis . generally speak , the wide be the spatial extent of activity of the confirm case link to hot spot identify by the SE-risk map , the high be the value of the current method to pandemic control and public health . we reconstruct the AS space–time trajectory of the confirm case associate with some facility of class 1 PSR to check the consistency of the finding and establish the value of the SE-risk map in screen facility base on historical travel-activity record from TCS-2011 . To estimate the value of this approach , the empirical pattern of COVID-19 case or disease cluster associate with these popular public facility be compile and the SDE represent as map for geovisualization . Mann–Whitney U test statistic be compute to ascertain the degree of correspondence ( p = @card@ ) between the actual AS of confirm case and potential as base on this approach . table 1 show the summary result of difference-in-means test for the six public facility ( see Supplemental Table S2 for detailed statistic ) . there be evidence to support both H1 and H2 for two type of public facility : bar and small-medium shopping center . these public facility be associate with user with high as and STP , especially when they exist in high facility agglomeration and in urban area ( Class 1 PSR in Group A , Table 1 ) . H1 be reject for the other four type of public facility : karaoke & cinema , mega shopping mall , public library , and sport centre . our result show that this second group of public facility be associate with user of high as and STP but in area with low facility agglomeration ( Class 1 PSR in Group B , Table 1 ) , perhaps suggest a lack of similar type of provision in the wide community . among the four type of public facility , H2 be reject for karaoke and cinema and sport centre , suggest that these facility tend to attract more mobile user in suburb compare to urban area . furthermore , our result show that the remain public facility ( i. e. , public library and mega shopping mall ) frequent by highly mobile user tend to be the more isolated establishment or location with low facility agglomeration in the urban setting . next , the full list of six type of public facility be integrate and the resultant location assign into four PSR class , as show by group A & B in Fig . 2 . these location by PSR class be visualize in Fig . 3a . of particular interest be the red triangle and orange circle represent area of superspreading environment and localized infectivity respectively . figure 3b transform fig . 3a from the point symbol representation into a risk surface or the SE-risk map with dark shading denote high risk . the number location represent empirical datum of actual disease cluster occur between February and July @card@ inclusive . by visual inspection , the actual disease cluster seem to fall in high-risk area with identifiable hotspot in Fig . 3b . To consider the empirical value of the analysis to inform policy maker , we identify two bar designate as class 1 PSR by our method and plot the AS space–time trajectory base on TCS-2011 ( Fig . 4a ) . our method show as of wide coverage indicate patron of bar be not limit to nearby resident . then , we reconstruct the AS time–space trajectory of the infected case from the same bar base on information from trace study conduct by the CHP and news report from local medium ( Fig . 4b ) . the derive as show a large spatial extent of comparable pattern . Mann–Whitney U test indicate no significant difference in the areal coverage of AS between our method and the actual occurrence ( p = @card@ ) . target the environment to complement superspreader research be need . our study illustrate the potential value of map hot spot of superspreading environment in an ex-ante manner by combine geographical setting with pre-pandemic human mobility datum . the SE-risk map can serve as a useful reference for policy maker in target facility for more differentiate NPIs . the wisdom of Dr John Snow more than @card@ year ago have highlight the importance of associate disease case ( that be , cholera ) with the location of public facility ( that be , public water pumps)29 . give the challenge of a pandemic with no effective vaccine and cure , NPIs be necessary to “ avoid peak of case that would overwhelm hospital and intensive care unit ( ICU ) capacity and result in hundred of thousand of deaths”30(p 1 ) . current observation and the global trend have indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic be likely to last for some time . it have become increasingly difficult to enforce citywide lockdowns that carry serious political , economic and social ( include health ) consequence . identify individual with the disease ( at the pre-symptomatic stage ) , reduce the time for diagnosis and laboratory test , proper isolation of the infected , and trace of the whereabouts of the individual that they have be in contact with , will remain critical in this fight against coronavirus . these persistent effort have put pressure on people’s everyday life , and the already strain healthcare and laboratory resource worldwide . One major challenge in a pandemic be the rapid and unpredictable transmission of disease associate with superspreaders . use the conceptual and methodological framework of superspreading environment , our analysis have demonstrate the potential value of integrate geographical knowledge and human mobility pattern to predict the “ origin ” of disease cluster base on the activity type , facility feature , and user ' travel-activity pattern . One limitation of the study be that we have to use travel characteristic survey datum from @card@ to analyze a pandemic of @card@ . since that year , complex change in people’s activity-travel pattern may have happen as the city’s urban form and transport system evolve . this issue may hinder the accuracy of the study . with more update datum , the result of the study would be more accurate . despite this limitation , the usefulness of the technique be validate . besides , the selection of public facility conducive to disease spread and insight derive from the potential risk surface may be more applicable to COVID-19 in particular and other respiratory pathogen in general , and somewhat relevant to infectious disease with other mode of transmission . the generalizability of the potential risk surface may thus be constrain . in term of future research direction , more factor which be know to contribute to the formation of superspreading environment , such as poor indoor ventilation , can be consider and integrate into the current analysis . in parallel , there be a need to refine the research by consider more characteristic both about the user and the facility . for the former , superspreaders of certain occupation work in a superspreading environment may result in even high public health risk . for the latter , facility locate at mixed commercial-residential area can be an extra risk factor . in addition , our current study make use of historical travel characteristic datum to compute AS and STP of individual . the widespread use of smart card and mobile device with self-tracking application and big datum analytic software can provide more refined mobility datum to construct the SE-risk map use our propose method31,32 . Nonetheless , NPIs that focus on modified human behaviour from wear mask and hand disinfection to reduce travel and social activity must go hand in hand in fight the pandemic .   COVID-19 and Acute Pancreatitis : What do surgeon Need to Know ? with reference to the clinical presentation of AP , we be yet to know the full spectrum of the pancreatic injury in COVID-19 . base on the currently available report , there can be an isolated rise in the pancreatic enzyme without any clinical or radiological evidence of AP , subclinical disease with only serological and/or radiological evidence of AP , “ pancreatitis-like clinical presentation ” , and finally , it can be an overt episode of AP ( Table 1 ) [ 3–7 ] . Wang et al . earlier report @card@ % incidence of pancreatic injury among @card@ patient with COVID-19 pneumonia . serum marker be mildly elevated ( mean serum amylase @card@ ± @card@ U/L and serum lipase @card@ ± @card@ U/L ) . however , none have abdominal pain or clinically severe pancreatitis [ 3 ] . when compare with the patient without pancreatic injury , those with pancreatic injury have a high incidence of anorexia and diarrhoea , severe illness on admission , low level of CD3+ T cell and CD4+ T cell count , and high level of serum aspartate aminotransferase , gamma glutamyl transpetidase , creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase . Liu et al . also show @card@ % incidence of pancreatic injury in @card@ severe COVID-19 case although injury be evident on compute tomography ( CT ) scan in only @card@ % case , mainly as focal pancreatic enlargement or pancreatic ductal dilatation [ 8 ] . incidence of pancreatic injury be low ( @card@ % ) in patient with mild disease [ 8 ] . however , none of the patient with pancreatic injury present with abdominal pain or have pancreatic necrosis [ 8 ] . on the contrary , severe AP have also be report ( Table 1 ) . Hadi et al . report familial cluster of COVID-19 case with two of three family member with COVID-19 have AP [ 6 ] . One of these case have no abdominal symptom but have rise pancreas specific serum amylase level that warrant further investigation , and diagnosis of AP be make on ultrasonography that show inflame edematous pancreas without gallstone [ 6 ] . Anand et al . report a case of COVID-19 who initially present with fever , cough , sore throat and myalgia [ 7 ] . patient recover from this illness but present again with abdominal symptom 5 day after the discharge . adhesive intestinal obstruction be suspect , but later , AP be diagnose on CT scan that show diffusely edematous pancreatitis . however , pancreatic enzyme assay be not do either at admission or subsequently . although author consider AP idiopathic in nature in this case , they do suspect causal relationship between COVID-19 and AP due to their temporal association [ 7 ] . none of the case report so far have necrotising pancreatitis even though some be classify as severe , and none require any intervention for pancreatitis-related local complication . various mechanism might be involve in the pancreatic injury in COVID-19 . severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) seem to have an affinity for the pancreas as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor be express in the pancreas , both in the exocrine gland and islet cell [ 8 ] . such expression have be show to be high in the pancreas than in the lung [ 8 ] . thus , pancreatic injury can result from the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 mediate by its local replication [ 3 ] . another putative mechanism involve dysregulated immune response induce by SARS-CoV-2 that target pancreas in addition to the lung and kidney cause AP besides organ failure [ 3 ] . however , organ failure can also occur in AP secondary to other cause ( e. g. biliary pancreatitis ) in a patient with COVID-19 who might otherwise be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic . such presentation can be encounter more commonly in near future with the increase prevalence of COVID-19 . lastly , AP can also result from drug-induced injury either directly ( e. g. use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) or glucocorticoids ) [ 3 , 8 ] or indirectly ( through tocilizumab-induced hypertriglyceridemia ) [ 9 ] . it be important to make the correct diagnosis of AP in COVID-19 patient although it can be difficult . isolated rise in the pancreatic enzyme in a patient with COVID-19 should not be attribute to AP without clinico-radiological correlation as such rise can be non-pancreatic in origin and can be see in gastroenteritis and lung injury also , especially in the presence of renal or respiratory failure ; condition commonly present in severe COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . rather , criterion as per the revise Atlanta classification should be use to make the correct diagnosis which require at least two of the follow three criterion : ( 1 ) typical abdominal pain , ( 2 ) serum amylase or lipase > 3 time the upper normal limit , and ( 3 ) characteristic finding on diagnostic imaging ; the latter might play more significant role in COVID-19 patient where clinical evaluation for abdominal symptom might not be feasible in severe case require intensive care unit care with ventilatory support . as target organ be same in severe AP and severe COVID-19 , acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute renal failure result from the latter can lead to inaccurate severity assessment of AP and response assessment when “ step-up ” approach be adopt to deal with local complication . in addition , occurrence of AP can aggravate the inflammatory response already induce by SARS-CoV-2 lead to accelerate organ failure . possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreatic tissue be also a concern for the surgical team . as this virus have be detect in the peritoneal fluid with a load high than in the respiratory tract [ @card@ ] , there be a possibility that this virus could also be present in the ( peri ) pancreatic fluid and necrotic tissue . in addition , viremia may not be directly relate to the severity of symptom , and all the patient , irrespective of the symptom’s severity , could have viral load in the peritoneal fluid [ @card@ ] . although the possibility of viral load in pancreatic necrotic tissue and fluid be uncertain , intervention require to manage local complication ( acute necrotic collection or wall off necrosis ) , whether percutaneous , endoscopic , or minimally invasive ( retroperitoneal/transperitoneal ) , might expose the health care worker to SARS-CoV-2 , more so with high-risk aerosol generate procedure like endoscopic or minimally invasive drainage / necrosectomy include video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement ( Vard ) . in addition , it be unknown how long virus might persist in the ( peri)pancreatic fluid or tissue that become relevant while manage symptomatic pseudocyst or walled-off necrosis once acute episode be over . surgeon should be aware of that ( 1 ) pancreas be not immune to COVID-19 though its involvement seem to be uncommon and much less as compare to digestive tract involvement ; ( 2 ) in patient with COVID-19 , elevation of the pancreatic enzyme seem to be common but can be attribute to acute pancreatitis in all the case ; ( 3 ) diagnosis of AP should follow standard criterion ( revise Atlanta ) in COVID-19 patient , although accurate severity assessment can be a problem ; ( 4 ) development of severe AP in a patient with COVID-19 be a double-trouble for both the patient and physician alike because of the diagnostic dilemma , possibility of common target organs(s ) involvement and accelerate clinical course ; and ( 5 ) those involve in the interventional management of moderate / severe necrotising pancreatitis need to be more careful give the unknown possibility of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through drain fluid or necrotic pancreatic tissue during procedure . our knowledge and understanding about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and pancreas be limit at present , but be expect to evolve rapidly give the increase prevalence of COVID-19 in the population that would allow us to formulate appropriate management strategy . at present , it be imperative for the surgeon to keep in mind the possible association between COVID-19 and pancreas as they might be involve in the management of AP at some point of time during its course .   the collateral cardiovascular damage of COVID-19 : only history will reveal the depth of the iceberg this editorial refer to ‘ All-cause mortality and location of death in patient with established cardiovascular disease before , during , and after the COVID-19 lockdown : a Danish nationwide cohort study ' , by J. Butt et al . , doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehab028 . the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) pandemic be an unprecedented global public health emergency that have dramatically change all aspect of our life . To date , the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) have infect almost @card@ million people and directly cause >2 million deaths.1 To prevent the spread of the virus and relieve pressure on healthcare service , government enforce lockdown measure . at the same time , healthcare system rapidly repurposed by redeploy resource and staff to tackle this unique challenge . these strategy limit the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 but disrupt usual care pathway for non-COVID-19 condition . the prevalence of cardiovascular disease have consistently increase over time as effective intervention have prolonged survival . despite this , they be still the lead cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , mandate ongoing effort to provide prompt diagnosis , complex intervention , structured follow-up , and uninterrupted care.2 the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic have abruptly discontinue this continuum of care for all cardiovascular condition , with potentially devastating consequence . in this issue of the European Heart Journal , Butt et al . provide an interesting analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient with cardiovascular disease in Denmark.3 use the Danish nationwide registry , the author do not find a difference in overall mortality for patient with established cardiovascular disease compare with the same period in @card@ , despite lockdown measure and healthcare reconfiguration . they find low in-hospital mortality that be , unfortunately , counter-balanced by high out-of-hospital mortality . this important contribution add to a grow literature on outcome for patient admit to hospital with cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic . furthermore , this report be one of the first to describe parallel change in out-of-hospital mortality of patient with cardiovascular condition and the temporal association with lockdown measure . the COVID-19 pandemic have affect country differently for several reason , include the timing and extent of lockdown measure , which have range from almost none to severe draconian approach . these measure be typically accompany by public health message urge the public to stay at home whenever possible . most country have struggle to manage the dramatic increase in demand for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic , and many system have be stretch significantly , to the verge of collapse . the reconfiguration of both primary and secondary care have include the redeployment of medical staff , sudden cessation of routine face-to-face appointment , interruption of establish care pathway , and reduce availability of medical facility . together with the public’s hesitancy to present to primary or secondary care , for new and established cardiovascular disease , this have result in important change in hospital admission for cardiovascular condition ( Table 1).3–22 most report have consequently describe a significant reduction in admission rate , include for acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure.3,8,14,16,17,23 patient often present late , sick , and with a high prevalence of comorbidities.5,17,23 moreover , in-hospital management change : patient with cardiovascular condition require admission be more frequently admit to general medical ward , and have short length of stay and increase complication rate for invasive procedures.7,8,14,16,19 in this situation , despite low absolute admission number , the resilience of healthcare system to accommodate patient with more advanced disease be limit , ultimately lead to high in-hospital mortality rates.5,7,13–15,19 Denmark promptly implement local restriction and experience a relatively low burden of COVID-19 compare with some other countries.3 this might have result in the preservation of specialist hospital care that , despite the reconfiguration of medical service , contribute to avoid the excess in-hospital mortality compare with non-pandemic periods.3 Nonetheless , the implication for country that have be more aggressively affected have be more unfavourable,5,7,13–15,17,19,23–25 and the finding of Butt et al.3 should be interpret in the context of the wide sequela of COVID-19 . on the other hand , less be know about out-of-hospital mortality due to cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic . To date , this be one of the few report address this important topic . as report by Butt et al . , out-of-hospital mortality be significantly high in Denmark during the lockdown , although it have a limited impact on overall mortality.3 the high out-of-hospital mortality also report in other country have be attribute to lockdown restriction and reluctance to seek medical care.3,7,24 furthermore , delayed provision of medical help result in high rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic , which be associate with increase response time and a significant reduction in advanced life support for these patients.25 together with increase in-hospital mortality , these factor have combine to worsen overall outcome and result in significant excess mortality for patient with cardiovascular diseases7,24 ( graphical abstract ) . To date , while we continue to experience further wave of the COVID-19 pandemic , exacerbate by the advent of new strain of the virus , we can only as yet hypothesize about a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the global collateral damage . the potential global implication for patient with cardiac disease relate to miss or delay diagnosis , reduce availability of routine testing , interrupted referral pathway , lack of proper and timely optimization of medical treatment , prevention of exacerbation , postpone or cancel follow-up , and reduce specialist care . similarly , disruption in research , education , teaching , training , and personal growth for healthcare professional will compound these insult . furthermore , several hitherto uncharacterized feature of the pandemic be likely to have affect cardiovascular health , include lifestyle change , reduction in physical exercise , home working , disrupt education for pupil , reduce social interaction , more perilous mental health , and socioeconomic hardship . these may play a substantial role , in both the short and long term , in how history view the interplay between the COVID-19 pandemic and cardiovascular disease . these and other , as yet undetermined , social and medical factor will undeniably contribute to the longstanding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . therefore , the available report of short-term out-of-hospital mortality be certain to be only the tip of the iceberg . while it appear crucial to continue specialist and uninterrupted medical care for at-risk group , include those with cardiovascular condition , further research be need to well understand the full scope of contributory factor to cardiovascular mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic , beyond infection rate . this information be essential to determine the good approach to care for patient , improve outcome in extreme condition , and minimize collateral damage in future outbreak . novel analysis , like the elegant one publish in this issue of the journal,3 be need and welcome to address direct and indirect consequence of the pandemic . however , while comprehensive research will help us well understand the implication for patient with cardiovascular disease , for now , the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular disease can yet be see . only history will reveal the depth of the iceberg .   “ Digital Clinical Placements ” : challenge in a Lower Middle-Income Country To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and a nationwide lockdown in Nepal , my medical school shift in April @card@ from traditional classroom-based lecture to online theory class . in these time , “ digital clinical placement , ” as propose by Sam et al,1 seem like the most plausible way of continue medical education . however , such virtual clinical placement present a set of challenge for a low middle-income country like mine . the technology require for digital clinical placement might not be as easily available in low- and middle-income country as they be in higher-income nation . before the pandemic , medical education at my institution rely on traditional lecture and “ real-life ” clinical placement . technology use be largely limit to lecture slide presentation and occasional audiovisual aid . online learning be a new method of teach and learn in Nepal . neither my country’s policy nor its infrastructure seem to have catch up with this novel modality . the Nepal Medical Council have announce that it will not accept any substitution for the usual in-person and hands-on training in a medical school . therefore , virtual clinical placement will not be consider the same as hands-on placement for completion of medical training and eligibility for a medical license . but with an increase number of COVID-19 case and a second nationwide lockdown in place , my institution decide in August @card@ to trial some practical class ( online placement ) . unfortunately , the lack of reliable Internet access and the unreliability of mobile datum prove to be a major constraint for some of my colleague who return to their village during the pandemic . a few of them have not be able to attend any or most of the online class . for the rest of us , poor audio and video quality due to slow Internet connection have affect the clarity and smoothness of the class . for example , identify clinical instrument and specimen be an essential part of our clinical placement and university examination . learn them through the pixelated video , because of poor connection and use of integrated webcams , have be difficult . moreover , the very essence of clinical placements—patient history , examination technique and finding , investigation and management plans—all of which should be include in a “ digital placement”1—seem to be lack . therefore , while the uncertainty of the future be still in place , with COVID-19 case rise and the possibility of a third lockdown , for now we be eager to resume in-person training in our institution in October @card@ .   the utility of Anti-Covid-19 Desks in Italy , Doubts and Criticism as of the 14th of September , Italy have be consider one of the more susceptible nation in term of risk of increase for Sars-Cov-2 contagion . in parallel , during the same period , about 5.6-million student physically come back to school from the last lockdown in February [ 1 ] . it be concretely hard for the Italian @card@ Covid-19 Emergency Technical–Scientific Committee to set new rule to get student back to class . arduous decision be make , especially when some barrier be difficult to be overcome . in particular , the physical distance between student would be simple to be set if classroom have be permit to host the same quantity of student with the right “ safety space ” around them . before the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown , this safety area be quantify as @card@ square meter . however , the Italian school system chronically suffer from an infrastructure deficit and this situation be due to the paucity of investment over time [ 2 ] . the Italian Ministry of Education ( MIUR ) decide to invest enormous resource in special desk to promote , in the first instance , high interpersonal distance in the classroom to avoid the risk of infection . the stimulation of innovative teaching be a secondary factor in this decision . however , these mobile desk be preferred because they permit a rapid adjustment in the classroom layout . these new desk feature a unique body , with a small inclinable mini-desk on the right side place over a support frame end with six wheel ( design to move around the classroom well ) and a rubber seat . this desk respect the standard of chair and table for educational institution ( EN @card@ and EN 1729-2:2012+A1 ) . this political decision become an opportunity for a bitter media attack on the Italian government . in fact , the reason for desk replacement be unjustified since traditional desk be not fix to the floor and their surface be design to be clean by @card@ % alcohol clean agent . from the economic point of analysis , the total provisional expense have not be never disclose . a single desk cost about @card@ euros : the global expect amount , in term of the quantity of desk replace , be predict as be about @card@ million euros . furthermore , the cost of old desk disposal have be not compute . this apparently unjustified decision , with high public spending , trigger polemic from the public . exacerbate this , a further critique be make stress that these seat be not ergonomically adapt for student . in fact , for example , no adjustment can be carry out by student use these “ new-concept ” desk . moreover , tall student with longer low limb could involuntarily induce the mobile chair to slip backwards due to the design’s inappropriate leg length . last but not least , left-handed people will have some trouble write because of the shape of the table . be there any scientific proof about the unergonomic design of these “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” ? be there any scientific proof show that these “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” avoid infection or reduce virus transmission among student ? obviously no because no study be yet do on this topic . be it really essential to incur this expense to safeguard the health of our child ? this final question probably fit with the Gospel accord to Luke “ why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye , but fail to see the beam of wood in your own ? ” , namely that the Italian government have spend a lot of money to buy new desk while leave out one of the main problem face by Italian schoolchildren , which be physical inactivity . it be well know the incremental decrease in children’s physical activity be observe in Italy despite a decrease in childhood overweight and obesity , the prevalence of which be still among the high in Europe [ 3 ] . this trend be a sort of “ syndemic ” condition that affect child of all develop country and that increase drastically during a force rest period such as the COVID-19 lockdown . with respect to scientific evidence in the literature show that the proper use of a backpack and the right preventative measure reduce physical problem and back pain in schoolchildren [ @card@ ] , no data have yet be find that suggest or confirm that the new “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” reduce the risk of contamination . with this editorial , we hope to stimulate a reflection by expert in the field of biomechanic , ergonomics and physical activity and our reader . in this optic , we speculate that after a force rest period of reduce physical activity due to the COVID-19 lock-down , the well public expense to improve the wellbeing of our child should be increase spending on encourage safe physical activity instead of buy “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” . that could lead to a low risk of child develop chronic condition relate to physical inactivity .   Association between Abo blood group and susceptibility to COVID-19 : profile of age and gender in Iraqi patient Coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) be a pandemic respiratory infection cause by a novel coronavirus term severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . it have be originate in the city of Wuhan ( Central China ) and show a global spread with accelerate rate associate with increase morbidity and mortality that seriously impact public health worldwide [ 1 ] . the disease have spread across @card@ country and up to the 15th of November @card@ , a total of @card@ confirm COVID-19 case have be report with @card@ % death rate ( @card@ case ) . the corresponding figure for Iraq be @card@ case with @card@ % death rate ( @card@ case ) . these figure rank Iraq as the 20th among other world country [ 2 ] . up-to-date , there have be no effective therapeutic medicine or vaccine that aid in control this communicable disease . therefore , it be essential to understand risk factor that may contribute to evolution of COVID-19 . epidemiological review have depict that all population be generally at risk to develop the infection . however , some susceptibility factor have be suggest to increase the risk of COVID-19 , and age may be among these factor . although all age group be at risk of develop the disease , elderly people be more likely to be severely affect by COVID-19 . child have be observe to have less severe clinical symptom , but critical illness have be find in those young than 1 year old . it have also be suggest that infant may be at high risk of severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 [ 3–5 ] . gender have be further describe as a risk factor for COVID-19 , and male tend to have a more severe disease than female . mortality rate be also high in male than in female [ 5 , 6 ] . some biological determinant of the host have\n",
            "also be consider as prominent marker associate with susceptibility to COVID-19 . among these determinant , Abo blood group have recently be introduce as important predispose factor in the development of infection [ 7–15 ] . Abo blood group and since their first discovery by Karl Landsteiner in the beginning of the last century have potentiate clinical , immunological and anthropological investigation . beyond their role in transfusion medicine , allele and phenotype of Abo system show racial- and population-based variation [ @card@ , @card@ ] . further , the risk of develop some disease be influence by allele or phenotype of Abo blood group ; for instance , blood group O in peptic ulcer , I*A allele in chronic myeloid leukemia , blood group A , B and AB in SARS , and blood group B and AB in pathogenic enteric infection . in infectious disease , host susceptibility may be relate to difference in antigen expression of blood group , which can serve as receptor and/or co-receptors for the infectious agent [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in line with these presentation , this study aim to investigate the genetic association of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) with risk of COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . in a previous issue of this journal , we suggest that group A be associate with an increase risk of death in COVID-19 case , while AB may be a susceptibility biomarker [ @card@ ] . however , the study be limit by low sample size of patient ( @card@ case ) . in order to gain a good understanding of these biomarkers in risk of disease , the sample size be increase to @card@ case . this sample size allow for Abo blood group to be re-analyze in COVID-19 case with emphasis on age and gender . thus , the confound effect of age and gender on the association between Abo blood group and evolution of COVID-19 be evaluate . during the period from May @card@ to July @card@ , @card@ , a case-control study be conduct to examine the genetic association of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) with COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . a total of @card@ patient be enroll in the study . they be admit to hospital in two major Iraqi city ( Baghdad and Basrah ) . the infection be molecularly diagnose by detect the coronavirus RNA in nasal swab of patient use a detection kit for @card@ novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ) RNA ( PCR-Fluorescence probe ; Da An Gene Co. , Ltd. of Sun Yat-sen University ; China ) . included patient be those with sign and symptom of respiratory disease and test positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid . patient with respiratory complication and test negative for the virus RNA be exclude from the study . datum on age , gender , and blood group for each patient be obtain from hospital record . a control sample of @card@ individual be also include in the study . they be blood donor and their anti-viral test at the Central Blood Banks ( Baghdad and Basrah ) be negative . the protocol of study be approve by the Ethics committee at the Iraqi Ministry of Health and Environment , and the guideline issue by this committee be follow . the phenotype of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) be give as number and percentage frequency . allele frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) be estimate use the software S2 ABOestimator ( http : //webpages . fc . ul . pt/~pjns/Soft/ABOestimator ) . genetic association of Abo blood group with COVID-19 be assess use logistic regression analysis ( adjust for age and gender ) and group O be the reference category . the association be express as odd ratio ( OR ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CI ) . age be give as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , and significant difference between mean be assess by one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) follow by either least significant difference ( LSD ) or Duncan 's multiple range post-hoc test . To assess the role of age in predict disease , receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analysis be perform to estimate area under curve ( AUC ) occupy by age . in this analysis , age be the test variable , while COVID-19 case be the state variable . a probability ( p)-value ≤ @card@ be consider statistically significant after apply Bonferroni correction ( pc ) . these analysis be carry out use the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics @card@ ( Armonk , NY : IBM Corp. ) . G*Power software be use to determine power of sample size . at alpha probability of @card@ and effect size of @card@ , the power of sample size be @card@ . accordingly , the representation of sample size be statistically validate . mean age be significantly elevate in COVID-19 case compare to control ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ year ; p < @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . a similar observation be make in male ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ year ; p < @card@ ) and female ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ ; year ; p < @card@ ) case , while there be no significant difference between male and female regard mean age in patient or control ( Fig . 2 ) . roc analysis demonstrate the predict significance of age in evolution of COVID-19 . the estimated AUC be @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ – @card@ ; p < @card@ ) ( Fig . 3 ) . male outnumber female in case ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and control ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) , but no significant difference be record ( p = @card@ ) ( Fig . 4 ) . however , age grouping ( < @card@ , @card@ – @card@ , @card@ – @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) reveal significant variation between case and control ( p < @card@ ) . approximately , @card@ % of COVID-19 case cluster in the age group ≥ @card@ year ( @card@ % ) . on the contrary , more than @card@ % of control be below the age of @card@ year ( Fig . 5 ) . distribution of age group in male and female case show no significant difference ( Fig . 6 ) . Abo blood group analysis show that group a be the most common among case , while blood group O be the most common among control ( @card@ and @card@ % , respectively ) . blood group A ( @card@ vs. @card@ ; pc = @card@ ) , A+AB ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ; pc = @card@ ) and A+B+AB ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ; pc = @card@ ) show significantly increase frequency in COVID-19 case compare to control . the estimated ORs of these variation ( logistic regression analysis : group A , A+AB or A+B+AB vs. O ) be @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) and @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . allele frequency of Abo blood group show no significant deviation from HWE in COVID-19 case or control . however , the case be characterize by increase frequency of p[A ] and q[B ] allele ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) compare to control ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) . conversely , the frequency of r[O ] allele decrease in case ( @card@ vs. @card@ ) ( Table 2 ) . frequency of blood group A , B , AB and O show no significant difference between age group ( < @card@ , @card@ – @card@ , @card@ – @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) in COVID case or control ( Table 3 ) . with respect to gender , these frequency show significant difference between male and female case ( p < @card@ ) . male case be characterize by increase frequency of group A ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and decrease frequency of group O ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) compare to female case . these difference between male and female be not observe in control ( Table 4 ) . therefore , Abo blood group be re-analyze independently in male and female . the analysis reveal that group a frequency elevate in male case compare to male control ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) , while group O frequency decrease ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) . logistic regression analysis ( group a vs. group O ) estimate an OR of @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , and the difference be significant ( pc = @card@ ) . on the contrary , there be no significant difference between female of case and control ( Table 5 ) . this study demonstrate that age , gender and Abo blood group might be important risk factor for COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . the mean age of patient approach the fifth decade ( @card@ ± @card@ year ) , and @card@ % of patient be classify in the age group ≥ @card@ year . these finding strongly suggest that individual age @card@ year and old be at great risk to develop COVID-19 . previous study have likewise report that elderly be more susceptible to COVID-19 than young adult . further , severity and outcome of disease largely depend on age of patient . most of hospitalize COVID-19 case ( @card@ % ) be age @card@ year and old and tend to have a high risk of death ( 23-fold ) compare to young patient [ 4 , 21–23 ] . although the elderly be at a great risk of some comorbidities ( cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obesity and respiratory system disease ) , immunological dysfunctional abnormality have be introduce as risk factor for the evolution of COVID-19 in the elderly population [ @card@ ] . Two immunological outcome have be correlate with aging ; inflamm-aging and immunosenescence . in inflamm-aging , elevate level of peripheral pro-inflammatory mediator ; for instance , interleukin ( IL)-1β , IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , have be report . their elevation may drive the development and maintenance of immunosenescence , which refer to aging-related immunological change that may have detrimental effect [ @card@ , @card@ ] . probably , most disease affect the elderly ( include COVID-19 ) be due to inflamm-aging and immunosenescence , as they contribute to what have be term a cytokine storm . the cytokine storm be describe as life-threatening organ-dysfunction syndrome due to abnormal host immune response against infectious pathogen . dyspnea , hypoxemia and inflammation in major organ ( the lung , kidney , heart , liver and brain ) be prominent outcome of the cytokine storm [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in severe COVID-19 case , it have be report that vascular inflammation be a substantial cause of microvascular injury and thrombosis due to complement-associated activation [ @card@ ] . further immunological change have be associate with age . they include decline generation of CD3+ T cell , increase CD4/CD8 T cell ratio , increase regulatory T cell ( Treg ) , decrease B lymphocyte and upregulated expression of toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) . these consequence may contribute to the poor outcome in elderly COVID-19 patient [ 28–30 ] . gender can also be consider a predispose factor for COVID-19 , and male may be more susceptible to the disease than woman . among the @card@ confirm case of COVID-19 , the proportion of male be high than that of female ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and the male : female ratio be @card@ . consistent with these finding , a Brazilian study report that @card@ % of @card@ case be male [ @card@ ] . on the contrary , most of epidemiological review and meta-analysis study report comparable rate of COVID-19 between male and female , but male tend to have high fatality and mortality rate than female [ 5 , 6 , @card@ ] . vulnerability of man for bad outcome of COVID-19 be probably due to gender-based immunological difference between man and woman , and this may impact the woman ability to resist infection include COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . sex hormone may mediate these variation between man and woman in the susceptibility to COVID-19 . experimental datum demonstrate that female mouse treat with an estrogen receptor antagonist show increase mortality rate due to SARS-CoV infection . thus , estrogen receptor signal have be consider a critical factor in protect female mouse from the infection [ @card@ ] . the gender disparity in morbidity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patient may also be relate to sex-biased difference in the lung expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , which serve as a receptor for COVID-19 entry into cell [ @card@ ] . the gene encode ACE2 be map to chromosome X , and its expression be also influence by sex hormone [ @card@ ] . collectively , these finding may explain gender drive modification in the COVID-19 outcome . besides age and gender , this study indicate that Abo blood group determinant can be consider biomarkers of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection , and group A , A + B , and A + B + AB have be associate with a significantly increase risk . in line with these result , Chinese and American study report that group a frequency significantly elevate in COVID-19 patient compare to control while group O frequency significantly decrease [ 9 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , 15]. . further , a genome-wide association study be conduct at seven hospital in the Italian and Spanish center of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Europe , and the analysis confirm that group A be associate with a high risk of develop COVID-19 , while group O have a protective effect compare to other blood group [ 37]. . in a study from China ( Wuhan city ) , the frequency of group a be significantly increase in COVID-19 patient compare to control , while group B , AB , and O frequency show no significant difference [ 9]. . a Spanish study suggest a low susceptibility to COVID-19 for group O , while a high risk of complication be find in group B patient [ @card@ ] . Canadian datum indicate that group A or AB be associate with critical illness of COVID-19 compare to group O or B [ @card@ ] . in a previous Iraqi study conduct by our group , susceptibility to COVID-19 be associate with group AB in patient from Baghdad , while group a be associate with an increase risk of death [ @card@ ] . in an Iranian study , no association be find with group a , but a significant decrease in group O frequency be record [ 7 ] . on the contrary , no association between Abo blood group and COVID-19 be find in French and Spanish patient [ 8 , @card@ ] . however , in a meta-analysis study , it be emphasize that individual of group a be at great risk of develop COVID-19 while those of group O be at low risk [ @card@ ] . further meta-analysis suggest that individual of group a may be more susceptible to COVID-19 , while individual of group O may have a low risk of develop the disease . however , the analysis also show no relationship between Abo blood group and severity of COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . although some inconsistent result have be report , most study agree that Abo blood group be of particular significance with regard to their association with susceptibility to COVID-19 , but the molecular mechanism underlie this association have not be well describe . it have be hypothesize that the blood group impact on susceptibility to COVID-19 may depend on a differential cluster of the virus glycoprotein receptor on host cell surface , induce by ABO(H ) determinant through interaction ( carbohydrate-carbohydrate ) with the glycan motif of these receptor , and this may interfere with the binding of virus and its entrance to target cell [ @card@ ] . the carbohydrate structure of ABO(H ) blood group be not restrict to the surface of red blood cell , and other cell and tissue express these structure ; for instance , lymphocyte , endothelial cell , platelet , gastric mucosa and bone marrow . further , blood group antigen be present in secretion ( i. e. saliva ) of about @card@ % of individual ( Abo secretors ) [ @card@ ] . therefore , their involvement in physiological and pathological process may be expect during viral , bacterial and parasitic infection . further evidence depict that covalently-linked ABO(H ) structure be find in some plasma glycoproteins ; for instance , von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , and factor VIII ( FVIII ) . it have be demonstrate that non-O individual have significantly high expression of endothelial cell-associated VWF protein compare to individual of group O. The VWF expression be associate with pulmonary vascular endothelial cell and this expression be influence by the Abo determinant [ @card@ ] . in this context , elevate circulate level of VWF and FVIII have be demonstrate in patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia , and this may indirectly link Abo blood group with susceptibility to COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . similar to COVID-19 , group A have be associate with severe malaria , while individual with group O be less susceptible to the infection . further , group a individual be more likely to have debilitate age than those of group O [ @card@ ] . To gain further understanding of the ABO-COVID-19 association , Abo blood group be analyze in COVID-19 patient and control after stratification accord to age group ( < @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ @card@ year ) and gender . in the analysis of age group , frequency of group A , B , AB , and O show no significant difference between age group of patient or control . therefore , the study suggest that the ABO-COVID-19 association may not be influence by age . a similar conclusion be reach through a Chinese study , in which the COVID-19 case be divide into two age group ( < @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) , and Abo blood group frequency show no significant difference between the two group [ @card@ ] . however , a further Chinese study report a significantly increase frequency of group a and a significantly decrease frequency of group O in patient age ≥ @card@ year compare to patient in the age group < @card@ and @card@ year [ @card@ ] . with respect to gender , Abo blood group frequency show significant difference between male and female COVID-19 case , while no significant difference be record between male and female control . a re-analysis of gender-based association reveal that male of group A be more susceptible to COVID-19 than female of group A. in fact , female patient show no significant association with Abo blood group . these finding propose a predispose role for group A to develop COVID-19 in male . in line with these result , a Chinese study report that group A be encounter more frequently in male patient than in female patient [ @card@ ] . on the contrary , another Chinese study report that group a be a risk factor for COVID-19 in female but not in male . however , the study be base on low sample size of patient and control ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) [ 9 ] . also , no gender-related difference be see in Abo blood group among COVID-19 patient in two study from China and Spain [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the study result indicate that blood group a may be associate with an increase risk of develop COVID-19 , particularly in male .   major bleeding complication in critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia increased thromboprophylaxis be propose to COVID-19 patient to prevent thrombosisWe assess the bleed risk of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumoniaBleeding occur later than thrombosisBleeding occur once inflammation decrease thus favor heparin overdoseWe may reduce thromboprophylaxis dose once inflammation correct to prevent bleed patient with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection , also know as coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID‐19 ) , who be admit to intensive care unit ( ICUs ) have high rate of thrombosis , particularly pulmonary embolism [ 1 ] . there be a grow body of evidence that severe COVID-19 be associate with a prothrombotic state result from endothelial dysfunction and hyperinflammation , and characterize by high level of d-dimers and fibrinogen [ 2 , 3 ] . therefore , pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis be recommend . some expert advocate intensification of anticoagulation , from prophylactic to intermediate or even therapeutic dose for high risk patient [ 4 , 5 ] . however , the associated bleeding risk be unknown . the goal of this study be to investigate major bleed complication in a cohort of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine their relationship with inflammation and thromboprophylaxis . descriptive result be express as median [ quartile 1 , 3 ] or count ( percentage ) and be compare use Wilcoxon and Chi2/Fisher test . p < @card@ be consider significant . ( BiostaTGV , France ) . Fifty-six patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia be include . they be mostly man ( n = @card@ , @card@ % ) , with a median age of @card@ [ 53–69 ] year and increase body mass index [ @card@ ( 24–31 ) kg/m2 ] . all patient undergo invasive mechanical ventilation , with prone positioning in @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) . the low PaO2/FiO2 ratio within the ICU stay be @card@ [ 59–107 ] mmHg . Seven patient ( @card@ % ) be treat with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . the simplify acute physiology score ( SAPS ) II be @card@ [ @card@ ; @card@ ] . all patient be discharge at the time of data analysis . sixteen ( @card@ % ) patient have thrombotic event whereas @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient have major bleeding , include the 7 patient with ECMO . major bleeding event include 3 deep muscle hematoma , 3 gastrointestinal bleeding event , 3 vascular catheter bleed event and one intracranial hemorrhage . thrombotic event and bleeding event occur 9 [ 3–11 ] day and @card@ [ 14–23 ] day after ICU admission respectively ( p = @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . fibrinogen concentration and d-dimers have the same biphasic evolution : they be high in all patient at ICU admission : 7 [ 6–7.6 ] g/l and @card@ [ 1056–2122 ] ng/ml respectively ; they still increase to reach @card@ [ 7.4–9.3 ] g/l and @card@ [ 3544–9380 ] ng/ml on day 5 [ 2–9 ] and day 6 [ @card@ ] ( p = @card@ ) respectively ; then , they progressively decrease . during fibrinogen increase , @card@ % of the @card@ patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation have anticoagulant overdose , compare to @card@ % ( n = @card@ ) of them once fibrinogen decrease ( p < @card@ ) . anticoagulant overdose be measure @card@ [ 3.5–9.25 ] day after fibrinogen peak . the @card@ major bleeding event occur while inflammation be decrease , after 4 [ 3–5 ] day of fibrinogen decrease ( Fig . 2 ) . similarly , d-dimers be decrease in @card@ % of the bleed patient that have 2 measure of d-dimers or more within the week prior the bleed event . all patient with major bleeding be treat with anticoagulant ( UFH n = 7 ; LMWH n = 3 ) , all but one at therapeutic dose . Anticoagulation be supratherapeutic for 6 ( @card@ % ) patient on the day of bleeding or the day before ( Fig . 2 ) . half of the bleed patient die in ICU , compare to @card@ % of patient without bleed complication ( NS ) . we report that major bleeding be common in this series of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia . most of the major bleeding event complicate therapeutic anticoagulation , as previously observe in a cohort of @card@ ICU patient where the rate of bleed event in ICU be @card@ % , with @card@ % during therapeutic anticoagulation [ 7 ] . moreover , more than half of our bleeding complication occur while heparin , initially in therapeutic range , become supratherapeutic . this might be explain by the decrease in inflammation : indeed , heparin bind to antithrombin to mediate anticoagulant effect but also bind nonspecifically to other plasma protein that compete with antithrombin . during the hyperinflammation state , markedly increase level of acute-phase-reactant protein , include fibrinogen , contribute to heparin resistance [ 8 ] . then , decrease concentration of inflammatory protein , include fibrinogen , induce increase anticoagulant effect and potential overdose . these datum highlight to carefully monitor heparin in COVID-19 patient , use anti-Xa activity preferentially , to prevent under and overdosage , especially once the initial hyperinflammation decrease . as we record datum until ICU discharge , we observe a biphasic evolution of coagulation disorder during COVID-19 : first thrombotic event during the early hyperinflammation phase , then bleed event once inflammation reduce , as confirm by fibrinogen and d-dimers decrease . although more study be need to determine when the thrombotic risk period end , these datum suggest that intensity of thromboprophylaxis may be adapt to the kinetics of thromboinflammation : intensification of anticoagulation dose may be use during the initial hyperinflammation phase as propose by many expert [ 4 , 5 , 9 ] , then standard prophylaxis may be consider once the high thrombotic risk period end and fibrinogen decrease , to prevent bleed event . despite the limitation associate with the retrospective monocenter design of our study , these datum highlight the relationship between fibrinogen level , inflammation and risk of thrombosis or bleeding and the evolution of the risk during COVID-19 hospitalization . bleeding be likely to occur later during ICU stay when inflammation be decrease and expose to supra-therapeutic level of anticoagulation . Intensivists may modulate thromboprophylaxis strategy accord to inflammatory biomarkers , especially fibrinogen . moreover , when fibrinogen decrease repeatedly , anti-Xa activity should be control to adapt heparin dose .   make sense of the Socialist Market Economy examin the model of ‘ socialist market economy ' , a core theme be naturally the relationship between socialism and market , or socialism and capitalism . the contributor to this book agree that the market have gain increase prominence in all three country , China , Vietnam and Laos . the private sector today account for a relatively large part of the output in their economy , many state-owned enterprise be or be be privatize ( or ‘ equitized ' ) and the authority have open up for private solution within health and education , sector that traditionally be the responsibility of the state , also in a number of Western market economy . the grow influence of market solution in China , Vietnam and Laos over the last 2–3 decade be part of a large international trend . the most notable international example of the neoliberal influence on earlier socialist left-oriented party be the British ‘ New Labour ' party and the early discourse about the ‘ Third Way ' . the principal objective of the ‘ third way ' be to temper free-market capitalism with social justice , while attempt to avoid an ‘ excessive domination of the state over social and economic life ' ( Giddens @card@ : @card@ ) . there have be a long-term decline in the support of social-democratic and socialist party in Western Europe . during the 2017–2018 election this decline accelerate strongly . the situation in the former socialist East and Central Europe be equally grim for the left ( Berman and Snegovaya @card@ ; Rovny @card@ ) . the weakening of the political left in Europe have be long in the making , and be largely cause by deep structural change and the decline of European manufacturing during the late twentieth century . in this process , a considerable part of the traditional electorate of left-wing party have largely disappear as a social group ( Rovny @card@ ) . the left’s shift to the centre on economic issue and its acceptance of ‘ neoliberal ' reform such as privatization of part of the public sector , cut to taxis and the welfare state and deregulation of the business and financial sector have be point to as an important explanation for the sudden recent weakening of its position ( Berman and Snegovaya @card@ ; Mudge @card@ ) . when structural change in the socio-economic landscape of Europe can have such a profound impact on European politics , it should come as no surprise that the ‘ socialist market economy ' in China , Laos and Vietnam after three decade of high economic growth and globalization have also change in fundamental way . although the communist party be still in power in these three country , their economic and social policy have be transform , and the ‘ New Socialist Man ' of contemporary China , Vietnam and Laos have change accordingly ( Chen @card@ ) , and perhaps be replace by an urban , middle-class ‘ socialist consumer ' , as Hansen argue in his chapter . the communist party in China , Vietnam and Laos be child of similar type of class-struggle that see the birth of leftist party in the West , although as note by Cole and Ingalls in this volume , they to a large extent start out as rural movement , and their strong anti-imperialist strand be different from in the West . their root go back to the interwar period . they be strongly influence by anti-imperialist struggle against colonial rule in French Indochina , foreign dominance in the nominally independent China , fight against Japanese occupation during the Pacific Wars ( 1937–1945 ) and war against the United States in Korea ( 1950–1953 ) and Indochina ( 1963–1975 ) . the peasant support base be pivotal in many of these conflict and garner through aim and action to end rural inequality . the socialist movement in Europe fragment into communist and social-democratic political party , with the latter working towards evolutionary change within the existing system , whereas the communist regime coercively make sure the socialist movement in China , Vietnam and Laos remain communist.1 in the 1990s and 2000s , in particular China and late Vietnam , become host of the manufacturing industry that have be the backbone of leftist party in the West . but labour movement in globalize Asian capitalism be mostly very weak , something that rather ironically also be the case in the socialist market economy , as Nordhaug discuss in his chapter.2 furthermore , the left and right wing political dichotomy with regard to state and market have be different in Asia than in Europe . the original East Asian developmental state model in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan remain one of the chief point of reference , both analytical and political , for those who reject the neoliberal global order.3 however , the relatively strong state-driven economic reform in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan do not take place under the rule of socialist party , but under conservative or right-wing party . Japan’s economic miracle be largely form under the leadership of the conservative right-wing Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP),4 and the developmental state in South Korea and Taiwan be to a large extent shape under right-wing authoritarian rule ( Cumings @card@ ) . hence , the role of the state versus the market in economic reform have to be understand beyond the traditional schism of the political left versus the right , or socialism versus capitalism , as understand in Europe . moreover , the economic model of Japan , South Korea and Taiwan have change as well , and there be an ongoing debate about whether the classical developmental state model still be a viable option , under deep globalization in the world economy ( Tian @card@ ; Hayashi @card@ ) . describe the socialist market economy as ‘ Market-Leninism ' , London find in his chapter that resource allocation in China and Vietnam mainly take place through competitive market while key feature of the Leninist one-party state remain in place . state actor with close affiliation to the communist party control important part of the private economy , and the divide line between private and public enterprise be frequently blur . this view be echo by Bui Hai Thiem , argue that within a Leninist political system , a neoliberal logic influence the economic programme . accord to Bui Hai Thiem , in China and Vietnam , neoliberalism and statist socialism co-exist in a highly complex and fluid context . despite these similarity , there be difference in the state’s capacity to influence and transform their economy in our three case . these difference be root in long-term pattern predate their socialist market economy . China have strong capacity than Vietnam , which in turn have strong capacity than Laos ( e. g. creak and Barney @card@ ; Vu @card@ ) . in the process of adjust their socio-economic programme to ‘ the socialist market economy ' from the 1990s onwards , the authority in China , Vietnam and Laos embrace large part of the same neoliberal reform that both the social- democratic party in Europe as well as the East Asian developmental state all implement into their party programme in the 1990s and 2000s . however , in Laos , as note by Rehbein , it be only a small part of the elite that have truly embrace capitalism while a somewhat large share of the population still conform with old socialist value . the socialist market economy ' embrace of element of neoliberalism have be drive by four distinct , yet interlink factor . first , political leader realize that the market economy could serve as a tool use to deliver progress , not a different way of organize society . second , through trade and investment as mean to economic growth , their economy be expose to global capitalism , and the integration into the world economy mean they have to fulfil obligation in international treaty to facilitate for fair trade and reduce subsidy to state-owned enterprise . third , in respond to change expectation among the public as a result of increase living standard and the breakdown of previous socialist welfare institution , the authority have gradually implement modern welfare policy ( more so in China than in Vietnam , and more in Vietnam than in Laos ) in order to ensure social stability , of which private solution be important part . fourth , development success have lead to massive structural change in the socio-economic landscape in these country , like age , urbanization and change employment pattern , and the authority have be force to respond to these change . in Europe , the socialist left embrace neoliberalism to remain relevant for the voter , while in the one-party system in China , Vietnam and Laos , the authority embrace part of the neoliberal logic as a strategy for regime survival . nevertheless , as London remind us in his chapter , although the socialist market economy reflect element of neoliberalism , their political economy be not usefully understand as neoliberal . the urban middle class , the old enemy of the socialist project of a classless society , be now a central part of the of the ‘ socialist market economy ' project , although the term class be usually avoid . the middle class , or middle-income group in party rhetoric , be incorporate into the project to ensure stability , and be see as a pillar in the transition to a more consumer-based economic model . accord to Hansen , the middle class be generally relatively satisfy with the ‘ socialist market economy ' , at least as long as it continue to deliver economic growth . the ‘ socialist market economy ' model share some similarity with European democratic socialism in embrace element of neoliberalism , and it resemble the original East Asian developmental state model in how the state continue to play a strong role govern the economy . yet , the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have some unique characteristic . One obvious distinction be the one-party system with element from the old Leninist structure , and how this inform the protection of right , and issue like transparency and accountability . the shortcoming with regard to labour right be illustrate by Nordhaug in this volume . another divergent characteristic of the ‘ socialist market economy ' be the state control of land ownership . furthermore , as discuss by Bekkevold , the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have be mould in the context of a world economy very different from the time of the classical East Asian developmental state . the strong trademark of the ‘ socialist market economy ' model may be its pragmatism with regard to socialism and the market economy . the famous slogan associate with Deng Xiaoping—‘it doesn’t matter whether a cat be black or white , as long as it catch mouse ' and ‘ let some people get rich first ' , have continue to be a strong guide throughout the reform process . the socialist legacy still have a prominent position in party document and rhetoric , but the solution be increasingly market base . the pragmatism actually go beyond embrace the market . as Rehbein discuss in detail , Laos under a socialist market economy be a hybrid of socialism , capitalism and early structure . in China and Vietnam , Confucianism , another old enemy of the communist revolution , be now embrace , connect the model with their pre-socialist legacy . despite similarity with the East Asian developmental state in term of the role of the state , China , Vietnam and Laos have be more open to trade and foreign investment in the early phase of their reform , but like their developmental state predecessor they be also able to reap the benefit of globalization through labour-intensive manufacturing . the combination of one-party rule and be late developer within the context of a neoliberal global economy have make the socialist market economy into a unique development model . the market and private enterprise be now integral part of the socialist market economy . for example , the Vietnamese Party Congress in @card@ for the first time acknowledge the contribution of the private sector to the economy , and at the 5th plenum of the Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee in @card@ , it be state that the private sector shall be treat on a par with other sector of the economy . nevertheless , at the core of the socialist market economy be the idea that the state should retain control of key economic sector . One important way of retain state control of the economy have be through state-owned enterprise , but in all three country the state be now more selective in its ownership , with a focus on strategic sector . SOEs should thus be restrict to sector such as natural resource and public utility that be not sufficiently remunerative for the private sector , and sector that be important for national defence . in Laos , the authority have undertake considerable privatization even within one of the country’s key economic sector , hydropower electricity , and electricity company still own by the state be reform into self-finance commercial entity ( Songvilay et al . @card@ ) . examin reform of state-owned enterprise in Vietnam , Knutsen and Do Ta Khanh find that since @card@ there have be attempt to speed up equitization and privatization of the SOEs . in contrast to early reform of the SOEs when Vietnamese authority largely respond to demand from external agency such as the World Bank , the policy agenda be now more motivated ‘ from within ' , drive by bad debt and corruption in state-owned enterprise . the plan be to accelerate equitization of the remain SOEs that be not engage in strategic industry , and sell a large portion of the share in already equitized SOEs and list them on the stock exchange . however , in their respective chapter , Knutsen and Do Ta Khanh as well as Bui Hai Thiem , discuss how bureaucratic obstacle and vested interest have contribute to slow down the reform . the transition from plan to market economy in China , Vietnam and Laos be slow in the financial sector . in his chapter , Bekkevold discuss how the state largely remain in control in banking , finance and monetary policy , and that the state in all three country willingly intervene and regulate the capital market and their stock exchange . China , Vietnam and Laos have try to develop policy that both embrace the global economy and at the same time shield their political system and economy from too much exposure and pressure for reform . they be able to take advantage of be latecomer , integrate into global value chain through trade in good and facilitate for inward FDIs , and view trade and incoming FDI as necessary tool for economic growth without lose too much control of their respective economic policy , whereas they have take a more careful approach embrace capital market deregulation and foreign portfolio investment . the severe economic and political consequence of the Asian financial crisis convince them to strengthen their banking and financial system , but also to maintain a more careful approach towards financial globalization . the stock market in all three country be comparatively new phenomenon , and although foreign participation in their stock and bond market have rise in recent year , it remain relatively low compare with international peer . still , the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange be already among the large in the world in term of market capitalization . as Bekkevold note , such a fast growth of newly establish stock exchange with immature regulatory agency , human resource , auditing and reporting would cause grow pain in any country . as discuss by Bekkevold , the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund all point to vulnerability in the financial system of China , Vietnam and Laos . building institution , regulatory agency , law and competence to run a market economy take time , and be still very much an unfinished business in all three country . the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have fail with regard to environmental sustainability , at least up to this point in history . the rapid economic development have take a heavy toll on natural resource and the environment in China , Vietnam and Laos . the enormous scale of China’s economic growth have turn it into the world’s large emitter of climate gas , contribute to environmental degradation on a global scale . emission be increase rapidly also in Vietnam , although on a small scale . furthermore , in all three country , climate change and natural disaster threaten to undermine development . Cole and Ingalls indeed note that Vietnam’s and China’s exploitation of land and natural resource to meet economic priority have begin to take hold across the border in Laos , point to grow environmental and human impact as intensive commercial agriculture have expand into marginal rural space . while China and Vietnam have have some success in reforestation , they have export deforestation to Laos , which have become a frontier for investment in exploitation of land and natural resource in the Mekong region . the abundant river of Laos be be dam accord to the government’s target of become the ‘ battery of Asia ' , and although hydropower be a clean energy source and the policy be present as ‘ green growth ' it have irreversible environmental impact , undermine the viability of fishery in the river , displace livelihood and riverine farming and fishing community . in addition , Ortmann remind us that Vietnam be one of the most affected country when it come to climate change , with flooding of coastal area , salinated water destroy farming area and extreme drought . by @card@ , almost ten per cent of Vietnam’s population be expect to be affect by coastal flooding ( UNDP @card@ ) . climate change will also seriously affect economic growth and livelihood in China as well as in Laos . explain the reason for the relatively bad environmental protection record in the socialist market economy , Ortmann in his chapter point to how economic growth have be the basis for the legitimacy of the regime , to the detriment of environmental sustainability . moreover , there be a lack of checks-and-balances in the system , and many within the government have profit disproportionately from exploitation of the environment as the economic growth take off to unprecedented height . furthermore , authority have have low environmental awareness , with a shortage of skilled personnel within the government to implement environmental programme . Nonetheless , the situation be not totally dark . China be seemingly take the environmental challenge seriously . it be now take leadership in international climate diplomacy , which be a huge step forward from only one decade ago . after the COP @card@ meeting in Copenhagen in @card@ , China be accuse of ‘ hold the world ransom ' and see by many as a climate laggard ( McCarthy @card@ ) . today , China be an indispensable party to all matter concern global climate change ( Kaneti @card@ ) . China have implement a wide set of policy in sector like energy , mining , food , forestry and water to rectify decade of environmental neglect , and it be work towards a change in its energy mix with a large percentage of green energy ( Bekkevold and Tunsjø @card@ ) . however , it will take a long time before China run on green energy . for instance , coal consumption peak in China in @card@ , and government effort to improve the energy structure see coal use fall for a number of year . the decline halted and consumption rise again in @card@ , suggest China at time will de-prioritize energy saving and emission reduction to keep its economy run ( Hao and Baxter @card@ ) . Vietnam’s environmental governance capacity be not as strong as in China , but as Ortmann discuss in his chapter , environmental sustainability start to climb high on the agenda of Vietnamese policymaker after the turn on the century . accord to Ortmann , Vietnam’s authority have strengthen the power and professionalism of environmental agency , implement a number of legal reform , and build a strong partnership with corporation , NGOs and foreign donor in order to benefit from their resource and skill . similar to China , a focus on renewable energy—mainly hydro but increasingly also solar—coexists with large , state-owned coal and petroleum sector . in all three country , China , Vietnam and Laos , environmental sector management be relatively inclusive sector in the sense that the public be be consult and involve in policy to a large extent than on other matter . Ortmann point to the rapid growth of new societal actor in Vietnam as the clear indicator of the evolve governance structure , and these group be start to play an unprecedented role in policymak and implementation . activism outside of the state apparatus on environmental issue have be tolerate and even sometimes encourage . in addition , there have be an increase in environmental protest in local community , and in some case the public have be successful in pressure local government and business to comply with environmental regulation . the emergence of social medium have also help activist to mobilize community for environmental cause . a similar development be observe in China . in @card@ , the Xi Jinping administration fully embrace the concept of ‘ ecological civilization ' , which have be promote as an ideological framework for guide the future of Chinese politics and society . in @card@ , the Chinese government revise the Environmental Protection Law for the first time since @card@ . the modified law strengthen environmental protection by fine polluter . Ngo be permit to bring public interest lawsuit against those who violate the law , while local official be hold accountable for the environmental standard in their region ( Mühlhahn @card@ ) . these initiative from the political centre contribute to increase public awareness , and within this framework there be space for protest and negotiation at the local level between authority and citizen ( Hansen and Liu @card@ ) . there be a ‘ mixture of authoritarian and democratic feature ' at the implementation stage of environmental policy in China ( Ahlers and Shen @card@ ) . that say , China’s ‘ environmental state ' be find to be strong in rhetoric and strategy yet often weak in implementation ( Turiel et al . @card@ ) . the environmental sector in China , Vietnam and Laos be global both in term of increasingly contribute to global climate change , as well as in how the authority in these country now engage with the international community to address the challenge . as Ortmann and Cole and Ingalls show in their respective chapter , a wide range of international actor , include government , international organization like the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and various United Nations agency , large multinational corporation and civil society organization such as the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , participate in the policymak process and the implementation of environmental policy . China have the most unequal income distribution of the three socialist market economy . this have be a source of grow social tension . during the leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao in the early and mid-2000s , the government roll out a series of social policy initiative as a response to these tension and to stimulate domestic consumption and economic growth . at the time , unfair access to basic social service be an important reason for a grow number of local protest across the country , and people save a large part of their income to pay for basic welfare . the Chinese government abolish agricultural taxis , extended health insurance , secured access to basic education , pension and provide income support to both rural and urban resident . particular emphasis be put on reduce the gap between urban and rural population and a campaign to improve life in rural areas—‘Building a new and socialist countryside’—was launch . social policy continue to be a key instrument for the Chinese government also under Xi Jinping . as observe by Dalen in her chapter , high economic growth both force and allow the Chinese government to develop a more comprehensive social policy , and she argue that China have come a long way towards a universal welfare state for all Chinese citizen . in China , the official policy be now that the government be responsible for provide basic medical service or purchase certain service , and that non-basic medical service should be provide by the market . in @card@ the Chinese government present detailed guideline on develop a large-scale industry of private health service , while non-profit civil society organization be see as an integral part of the social policy system . moreover , China be give increase priority to digital solution such as e-health and e-learning . in fact , China have emerge as one of the global leader in promote information and communication technology for education ( ICT4E ) . even though China have take important step to establish a more comprehensive welfare system , it still face daunting challenge relate to inequality . while income be distribute more evenly in Vietnam and Laos than China , their performance be also want . the elite in all three country , include the most powerful so-called ‘ cadre-capitalist ' class ( so @card@ ) , have accumulate significant amount of wealth and power . China’s wealthy be among the rich in the world , with a steady increase in the number of super rich . while this number see a slump in @card@ follow economic slowdown ( Forbes 2019a ) , the wealth of the rich among them have continue increase ( Forbes 2019b ) . Five Vietnamese billionaire make it to Forbes ' list of the rich people in the world , include Vietnam’s rich person and owner of the powerful Vingroup conglomerate , Pham Nhat Vuong ( Dat Nguyen @card@ ) . the rich in Laos have not make it to the Forbes list , but the fact that former long-serving President Khamtai Siphandone be close to be a billionaire and consider the country’s wealthy man ( ProspectsASEAN @card@ ) serve as a reminder of the close connection between politics and economy also there . in his contribution to this volume , Hansen show that not only the rich , but also the new socialist middle class openly display their wealth . yet , display wealth can be risky . a number of billionaire in China have be imprison and even execute if they cross the line in term of crime , corruption or have the wrong political tie ( Anderlini @card@ ; Chao @card@ ) . smallholder farmer be at the core of the early socialist revolution . in the socialist period the farmer become rural worker in collective agriculture , although the depth and duration of collectivization vary between country and region . during the market reform farm family receive use right to land , and smallholder family agriculture become the prevalent model of the socialist market economy . rural income growth lag behind urban growth in the market reform . this trend have however be reverse in China and Vietnam , although the urban–rural income gap remain high . in Vietnam the average urban to rural income ratio decline from @card@ in @card@ to @card@ in @card@ ( CEIC , N. D. ) in China urban–rural income disparity peak in @card@ and have decline since then . the average urban to rural income ratio be @card@ in @card@ ( Naughton @card@ : @card@ ; China Statistical Yearbook : table 6–11 , 6–23 ) . datum be more sparse when it come to Laos , make a comparison difficult , but urban–rural inequality in term of consumption be grow from a relatively low start point during the period 2007/2008–2012/2013 ( World Bank @card@ : 2 , Table 4 ) . there be obvious and stark inequality between ethnic majority and minority population , and ethnic minority be grossly overrepresent in poverty statistic in all three country ( Banik and Hansen @card@ ; Pimhidzai and Houng Vu @card@ ) . another challenge be the transformation of the labour market , with more people employ in the so-called ‘ grey economy ' outside the established social safety net . Labour-intensive production with low-cost labour , mainly from rural migrant , have form the backbone of the export-oriented industrialization model in China and Vietnam . as Nordhaug show in his chapter , party-controlled labour union have not allow for the countervail force of labour union against employer , result in the economic growth take place under often dire condition for the worker . interestingly , Nordhaug demonstrate that Vietnamese local authority be more favourably incline to the demand of worker than their Chinese counterpart . Nonetheless , labour contract in the manufacturing industry guarantee access to basic service for an increase number of worker , but this be change as the economy move away from traditional industry towards service and innovation , particularly in China . look into the future , it will be increasingly challenging for the socialist market economy to fund the grow demand for welfare , as be the case for many Asian ( and indeed also American and European ) country . this be the case in China , where the growth be slow . and in all three country increase live standard have change expectation towards high demand , particularly from the emerge middle class . China be soon home to the large middle class in the world , and Vietnam have perhaps the most rapidly grow middle class in Southeast Asia . in his chapter , Hansen argue that to keep the middle class satisfy , the socialist market economy be more dependent than ever on deliver development , and as Dalen remind us , this also include welfare service . at the same time , China continue to face serious population challenge such as low and decrease fertility , a rapidly grow elderly population and a shrink labour force . in the year to come , further tax reform will be crucial in the financing of an ever expand Chinese welfare state , but Dalen observe that as for now , the willingness to pay individual tax be low in China , mean that indirect taxis and company tax be important source for financing welfare . moreover , there be a preference in China of the government as the main provider of welfare service , present the government with a challenge in promote non-state actor as key in the service delivery . in the transition to an economy drive by service and consumption , where innovation , technology and education will be key , new ‘ winner and loser ' will emerge in the socialist market economy , and new social risk can arise . China , Vietnam and Laos share the core characteristic of the ‘ socialist market economy ' model present earlier in this chapter . the one-party system be in place in all three country , as be the restrictive regime with regard to land ownership . they have all embrace important element of neoliberalism , but with the state still in control of key sector of the economy . for instance , they have all be relatively open towards trade and incoming foreign direct investment , and share similar reservation with regard to liberalization of their bank and finance sector as well as monetary policy . China , Vietnam and Laos have all be late-developers and pursue state-led strategy in a global context of neoliberalization . the three country have to different extent be able to take advantage of their latecomer position , particularly in term of attract foreign investment . China have manage to develop a strong domestic industry sector and be move towards high-tech , while Vietnam have face a ‘\n",
            "stalled transition ' ( Masina and Cerimele @card@ ) and mainly be able to develop a FDI-led labour-intensive industry sector which to a large extent depend on foreign technology . Laos be in this regard the odd one out , and have hardly see any industrial development . remain a largely agrarian and resource-exporting economy , the country’s development strategy and path have diverge significantly from those of its two considerably large and more powerful neighbour . furthermore , unlike China , Vietnam and Laos be heavily reliant on foreign aid in the early phase of reform , and Laos to some degree still be . the liberalization of trade and investment have facilitate for close economic cooperation between China , Vietnam and Laos , both through bilateral channel , between Vietnam and Laos within the framework of the ASEAN Economic Community , and with China through the China–ASEAN Free Trade Area . Nonetheless , as Bekkevold elaborate on in his contribution , China , Vietnam and Laos have historically have a complex relationship , and some disagreement continue to shape and limit their level of cooperation . One controversial issue be the dam of river in Laos , which take place with strong Chinese involvement , and with mainly negative consequence for Vietnam ( see Rfa , @card@ for a useful overview ) . due to the impact of dam on water level in the Mekong , Vietnamese authority have long be critical towards hydropower development in Laos , but Vietnam be also concern about China’s increasingly strong foothold in Laos , Vietnam’s historical ally . interestingly , in @card@ , the state-owned oil company PetroVietnam decide to invest in the construction of a large dam close to Luang Prabang in Laos , despite official Vietnamese statement against further dam of the Mekong . it be uncertain whether this decision be drive by commercial or geopolitical motive ( Fawthrop @card@ ) . China have emerge as the most important economic investor and developmental partner for Laos . although Thailand remain Laos ' main trading partner , China’s position in Laos be expect to be further enhance by the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) . Laos , as well as Cambodia ( Pang @card@ ) , seem to be drift into China’s sphere of influence . the situation be different with regard to Vietnam . for historic reason , there be still strong anti-Chinese current among the Vietnamese population , and as both Bui Hai Thiem and Bekkevold point to , they have overlapping claim in the South China Sea that go to the core of national security concern in both country . Vietnam seem to have more will and ability to resist a strong Chinese influence than Laos . the degree of cooperation between China , Vietnam and Laos and the coherence of their model , will continue to be shape partly by national characteristic and priority , and partly by the international context at any give time . in the next and final part of this chapter , we will look at some potential development and research agenda with regard to the future of the socialist market economy , at both the domestic and international level . an exhaustive list of future research agenda relate to the development of China , Vietnam and Laos be beyond the scope of this brief summary . yet we identify three broad cluster of issue that will be of importance ; economic development strategy ; political development ; and the positioning of these communist regime within a change international environment . development in these three cluster be closely connect and will influence each other . let us first look at economic development . China be in the midst of several transition of its economy , from export-driven to consumption-driven growth , from high growth to sustainable growth , and from labour-intensive to innovation-driven growth , and it be do so with a mix of state and market , and eventually Vietnam may face many of the same challenge as China in their industrial upgrading . One development to follow with particular scrutiny be the role of the state in innovation ( Baark @card@ ) . China have a very ambitious high-tech agenda , include the ‘ make in China @card@ ' programme . this be at least so far mainly a state-led industrial policy that seek to make China dominant in global high-tech manufacturing ( McBride and Chatzky @card@ ) . many of the sector in this programme be view as strategic industry , and the state be firmly in the grasp of it through an ‘ elite empire of state-owned enterprise ' ( Baark @card@ ; Naughton and Tsai @card@ ) . as a response to harsh criticism from the United States , call the ‘ make in China @card@ ' a subsidy-stuffer to advance China as a global technology leader at U. S. expense , China have downplay the policy , but not change it ( Wei @card@ ) . To the extent that China’s entry into the fourth generation industrial revolution and the introduction of artificial intelligence will be state dominate or more a mix of state and private entrepreneur will be important for the future of its economic model . in Vietnam there have so far be much talk of develop a domestic high-tech agenda , and there have be attempt to use the state-owned corporation sector to strengthen upgrade yet industrial policy have largely be miss , or unsuccessful . One important exception to this rule appear to be Vietnam’s state-owned telecommunication industry ( Ngo @card@ : @card@ ) . economic upgrading may be necessary to sustain the human development of the socialist market economy , but it be probably not sufficient . as argue by Nordhaug in his chapter , the socialist market economy face an uneasy balance between ‘ accumulation ' and ‘ legitimation ' . this apply not only to industrial relation , but also to welfare and sustainable development . human development and sustainable development will be important to avoid labour conflict , conflict over land and environmental protest that may not only disturb economic development but also result in instability . it remain to be see to what extent responsiveness towards popular concern and increase attention to environmental governance will contribute towards mitigate the so far dramatic environmental unsustainability of the socialist market economy . the second cluster of issue that will inform the future of the socialist market economy be political development . due to the continued one-party system in China , Vietnam and Laos , special attention have to be give to political development within these country . in multiparty system , the emphasis on state versus market solution will move in cycle depend on whether the government be predominantly leave or right wing . as allude to in our introduction , the gradual and evolutionary introduction of market reform in China , Vietnam and Laos have not be linear either , and each country have face crossroad where they have halt , turn or even reverse the process . Bui Hai Thiem call this the ‘ double movement of accommodate and resist neoliberalism ' . the political-economic cycle in the socialist market economy be not drive by change of government , but by internal disagreement , fraction , leadership priority or reaction to internal or external shock , like for instance the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s . in this volume , Rehbein describe how Laos since its Tenth Party Congress in @card@ seem to have return to a more socialist agenda , and the agenda be push by the remain hero of the revolution of @card@ . a grow number of report argue that particularly China—but also Vietnam ( Amnesty International 2018)—has rather become more rigidly suppressive in recent year ( McGregor @card@ ; Economy @card@ ) . in China , the Communist Party be see as take on a large role in all aspect of society and governance ( Batke @card@ ) , and the separation of party and government initiate under Deng Xiaoping be now be reverse , drive China in the direction of neo-socialism with a fusion of party and state responsibility ( Brødsgaard @card@ ) . China be attract attention globally for its method and innovative way of police society , include through its social credit system which be often portray as a dystopian nightmare resemble an Orwellian ‘ big brother ' society ( Mosher @card@ ; Chorzempa et al . @card@ ) . furthermore , there be a concern that the all-powerful leadership of Xi Jinping be weaken institutional governance ( Shirk @card@ ) , and it be even suggest that China have enter into some form of crony capitalism ( Pei @card@ ) . there be an inherent danger in top-down drive system of suppress development . the future role of the expand middle class , as discuss by Hansen in this volume , merit further research , include on how it might influence political development . so far , however , the middle class seem to be ‘ very much of the system ' ( Gainsborough @card@ : @card@ ) . the uneasy relationship between the moral expectation in party rhetoric towards responsible consumption and the embeddedness of increase consumption in the socialist market economy will also be important , particularly since the consumption pattern of these new middle class will have global environmental consequence . another topic to follow be the debate about authoritarian resilience , and the ability of the regime to adapt to the change environment ( Fewsmith and Nathan @card@ ; Nathan @card@ ; McGregor @card@ ; Shambaugh @card@ ) . the third main cluster of issue that will shape the future of the socialist market economy be large event and structural change at the international level . the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and the global financial crisis a decade later in different way inform development in China , Vietnam and Laos . even though the Asian financial crisis discredit the East Asian developmental state model at a global level , China , Vietnam and Laos interpret the crisis differently , and in the process of strengthen their financial system , they make sure that the state remain in control of the bank and finance sector ( Wong @card@ ) . the global financial crisis , at least as see from Beijing , increase the confidence in their own state-driven model , but it again lead to another round of debate on how to safeguard ‘ financial sovereignty ' ( Li and Zhou @card@ ) . the world economy be now face another type of international challenge , in the form of the Covid-19 virus . it bring two lesson for China , and possibly for the socialist market economy as model . first , the foot-dragging management of the outbreak of the virus in China will lead to internal criticism and demand for increase transparency , similar to what happen in the aftermath of the SARS in @card@ ( Chi @card@ ) . second , the effective manner in which the Chinese government have manage to contain the spread of the virus will certainly contribute to boost the confidence of the leadership in Beijing with regard to its own model . although originate in China , the virus have large consequence outside of China . at the time of writing , it be too early to comprehend the consequence of what be unfold , but Chinese authority have manage to largely contain the spread of the virus to one single province , while in most other country , and in particular in Europe and in the United States , the virus be spread across large part of the country . it mean that whereas China can do with a local shutdown of activity , other country have to implement a nationwide shutdown for an extended period , with long-term and wide-ranging economic consequence . already , a few week into the crisis , it be speculate that the Covid-19 crisis will further increase the standing of China on the international scene ( Campbell and Doshi @card@ ) , and end globalization as we know it ( Farrell and Newman @card@ ) . in that case , the Covid-19 crisis will reinforce structural change in world politics that have be unfold for some time already , as discuss by Bekkevold in his contribution to the volume . develop market economy be increasingly sceptical towards China’s economic model , criticize China’s use of state subsidy , unfair trade policy and manipulation of the currency . the United States have since the 1990s continuously convey this criticism towards China , but due to China’s recent arrival as an economic competitor and rival , the United States be now more willing to follow up its criticism with actual policy , and Europe and other developed country have turn more critical towards China . in the United States and Europe , the demand for protectionism be grow . in January @card@ , the United States and China reach a Phase-1 commercial agreement that bring to close their intense trade war , but it be argue that this deal may only be a short-term solution , and that the U. S. – China relationship increasingly will be characterize by a more permanent situation of economic competition and rivalry . at the core of the U. S. – China rivalry be China’s rise as peer-competitor , and not only in economic term , but as a military power . the United States be respond to this by move military asset to Asia , and by decoupling part of its economic tie to China . world politics be move from an era of deep globalization to a world more characterize by a political and economic divide between the United States and China . if this scenario unfold , it will have consequence for how connected China will be to the world economy , and the balance of state and market in its development model . during China’s trade war with the United States a number of foreign-invested enterprise move their operation from China to Vietnam . Nonetheless , in a more long-term outlook , a political-economic divide between China and the United States will place Vietnam as well as Laos within China’s sphere of influence .   downfall of Chemical Probes Acting at the Kinase ATP-Site : CK2 as a Case Study the catalytic domain of protein kinase consist of two part , the N-and C-terminal subdomain ; it be between these two subdomain , which be connect by a hinge linker , that the ATP-site be form . the N-terminal subdomain be mainly comprise of β-strands which close off the top of the active site , as well as a crucial α-helix , ( αC ) ; the C-terminal subdomain predominantly consist of α-helices ( Figure 1 ) . a “ gatekeeper ” residue in β-strand 5 ( β5 ) and a Lys in β3 form a divider , or a “ gate ” , between the front and the back of the catalytic pocket ( Figure 1 ) . access to the back of the pocket be control by the gatekeeper residue . if the gatekeeper be small ( e. g. , Ala ) the back of the pocket be accessible ; however , if it be a bulky residue ( e. g. , Phe ) , entry to the back of the catalytic pocket be obstruct . the Lys residue in the β3 strand ( Figure 1 ) be conserve in all kinase and be necessary for the catalytic activity of the enzyme ; the Lys help to secure the phosphate of ATP in the active site [ @card@ ] . the hinge linker contain a highly conserve Gly rich motif ( GXGXδG where δ be usually Tyr or Phe ) ( Figure 1 ) . the small size of the Gly residue allow the linker to come into close proximity with ATP and favourable interaction be form between the peptide backbone and the phosphate group of ATP [ @card@ ] . due to the well understand structure of the ATP site of numerous protein kinase , as well as the obvious effect on catalytic activity of the site , the development of ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor have be an active field over the past few decade . however , due to the highly conserve nature of the ATP-site , selective inhibition of protein kinase via active site inhibitor be extremely challenge to achieve [ @card@ ] . a large number of inhibitor target the ATP-site bind with donor-acceptor interaction to the conserve hinge region of the protein that naturally bind the adenine moiety of ATP ; bind to this region can produce strong interaction but often lead to more indiscriminate inhibitor [ @card@ ] . One of the first ATP-competitive inhibitor identify be staurosporine , a microbial alkaloid which in @card@ be find to inhibit protein kinase C ( PKC , IC50 = @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] . at the turn of the century , many cell permeable protein kinase inhibitor be regard as “ selective ” and be be use in cell assay to investigate the biological role of the protein kinase they target . however , in @card@ Davies et al . investigate the selectivity of @card@ commercially available “ selective ” protein kinase inhibitor and find that , exclude rapamycin and PD @card@ , all other inhibitor affect at least one other protein kinase , with most alter the activity of multiple . they also highlight that it be frequently not just closely relate kinase in the same family that be affect [ @card@ ] . these result be further build upon by Karaman et al . who screen @card@ kinase inhibitor against @card@ kinase . astonishingly , they identify staurosporine as a strong inhibitor of over @card@ % of the kinase panel test and thus , it be deem to be a pan-kinome inhibitor [ @card@ ] . although this be an extreme example , it highlight the great similarity amongst the kinome and the promiscuous nature of many ATP-competitive inhibitor . an alternative method of ATP-site inhibition develop by the Shokat group involve mutate the highly conserve gatekeeper residue of a protein kinase to a small Gly or Ala to create a uniquely targetable mutant kinase [ @card@ ] . this in theory facilitate the identification of specific inhibitor for each kinase . however , the inhibitor be typically only effective against the mutant kinase and thus , although an effective method for specifically modulate the activity of individual kinase , it do not represent a valid therapeutic strategy at this time . despite the challenge in their development , successful ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor have be develop , with more recently be approve for clinical use by the FDA [ @card@ ] . however , the majority of these compound have undesirable side effect and be use for the second-line treatment of cancer , where initial treatment have be unsuccessful [ @card@ ] . these compound be of great clinical importance ; however , the ultimate goal be the development of fully selective inhibitor with minimal off-target effect , make for a highly target therapeutic which be applicable in more than just the worst-case scenario . additionally , effective chemical probe for a wide variety of protein be require to thoroughly investigate biological pathway ; compound deem sufficiently selective as therapeutic agent may still not be effective chemical probe , provide convoluted result arise from the modulation of the activity of more than one protein . as such , highly selective molecule be need to successfully determine the specific role that different protein play in the biochemistry of live organism . casein kinase 2 , now commonly know as CK2 , be a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase belong to the CMGC group of kinase [ @card@ ] . CMGC kinase be typically involve in cell-cycle regulation , cell signal , cell communication and cell growth [ @card@ ] . CK2 phosphorylates over @card@ substrate and , as with other CMGC kinase , have multiple role in the cell cycle , include in cell growth , proliferation and survival [ @card@ ] . interestingly , unlike most other protein kinase , CK2 be constitutively active ; it do not require phosphorylation to exert its function [ @card@ ] . One of CK2′s key role in the cell be as an anti-apoptotic protein and , as such , it be see to be overexpressed in a wide variety of cancerous tumour include , but not limit to , lung , colorectal and prostate cancer [ @card@ ] . both healthy and cancer cell make use of CK2 , however , cancer cell be particularly sensitive to CK2 inhibition due to the absence of alternative pathway to compensate for its downregulation [ @card@ ] . promisingly , a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor , CX-4945 , be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma [ @card@ ] . it should also be note that , although the role of CK2 in cancer have be the most widely study , CK2 be also implicate in many other disease , include COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . CK2 have a heterotetrameric quaternary structure make up of two catalytic kinase subunits ( α and/ or α ' ) and two regulatory subunits ( β ) ( Figure 2 ) [ @card@ ] . CK2α and CK2α ' be code for by distinct gene and differ in their sequence mostly at the C-terminus ( CK2α have a longer C-terminal extension ) . they both act as catalytic unit in their own right and can come together in any combination to form the heterotetrameric holoenzyme , i. e. , ααββ , α’αββ , α’α’ββ [ @card@ ] . the β subunits control the substrate specificity and cellular localisation of the enzyme , as well as provide stability , while the α subunits phosphorylate the enzyme’s substrate [ @card@ ] . the structure of the catalytic subunit resemble that of a generic protein kinase , as describe previously ( Figure 2 ) . CK2α exist only in an active conformation without the need for upstream phosphorylation , unlike the majority of protein kinase which have an “ on ” and “ off ” form , reflect its constitutive activity . the N-terminal region link the two subdomain and cross the catalytic site , form favourable interaction with both the activation segment ( Asp175 to Glu201 , ( Figure 1 ) ) and a basic cluster of residue in the αC helix that recognise its substrate ( Lys74 to Lys83 , ( Figure 2 ) ) , stabilise the active conformation ; the close contact of the N-terminal region and activation segment be unique to CK2 and may contribute to the constitutive activity of the protein [ @card@ ] . the structure of the ATP site have lead to it historically be the main site for which inhibitor be develop [ @card@ ] . the heat map in Figure 3 quantitatively highlight that the vast majority of CK2 inhibitor develop to date bind to the ATP-site of CK2α , a handful to area surround the ATP-site and almost none to the opposite face of CK2α ( Figure 3a ) . the constitutive nature of the protein mean that the structure be always ready to accept an ATP-like molecule [ @card@ ] . additionally , the knowledge of the structure of both the active site and its natural partner , ATP or GTP , remove the problem associate with de Novo inhibitor design [ @card@ ] . as such , many ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK2 have be identify to date , include the orally available small molecule CX-4945 ( Figure 2 ) which be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma [ @card@ ] . this review focus on the most influential ATP-competitive inhibitor develop for the protein kinase CK2 , their synthesis , advantage and disadvantage and the new approach be utilise to render ATP-competitive inhibitor more successful . To the good of our knowledge , this be the only review that cover the discovery in the field that have take place in the last eight year [ @card@ ] . 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) be a nucleoside analogue , first identify as be biologically active in @card@ [ @card@ ] . the synthesis of DRB be well know in the literature with multiple facile route report , one of which be show in Scheme 1 [ @card@ ] . the inhibition of CK2 by DRB be detail by Zandomeni et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . however , DRB display only modest activity against CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ μM ) [ @card@ ] and be capable of inhibit multiple other kinase , such as CK1 , with comparable efficacy [ @card@ ] . in addition to this , DRB be also find to bind to the CK2α/β interface [ @card@ ] . as such , due to its promiscuity both in bind to CK2 and other kinase , DRB have limit use today . nevertheless , since its discovery , DRB have be the start point of many study to develop more potent and selective CK2 inhibitor , and many of the most widely use CK2 ATP-site inhibitor use currently be derive from DRB . the first major advance on DRB come from two primary improvement be make : the removal of the sugar moiety and the replacement of the chlorine atom with bulky bromine lead to the development of 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole ( TBB ) [ @card@ ] . the synthesis of TBB be first describe by Wiley and Hussung in @card@ by the combination of bromine and nitric acid with benzotriazole ( Scheme 2 ) [ @card@ ] . despite its somewhat simplify structure , TBB have a greatly improve potency compare to DRB ( Ki = @card@ vs. @card@ μM , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . it be originally believe that TBB be selective for CK2 , as deem against a panel of @card@ kinase [ @card@ ] . however , since then , the kinase panel available for testing have drastically increase [ @card@ ] and in a subsequent screen against a panel of @card@ protein kinase , seven be inhibit significantly ( >90 % , @card@ μM of TBB ) and six of these be inhibit more strongly than CK2 itself , which have 6 % residual activity [ @card@ ] . another concern with TBB be the possibility of cumulative toxicity arise from its large number of halogen atom although , thus far , this issue have not be see and TBB be not find to be toxic to mouse [ @card@ ] . despite its shortcoming , TBB be a drastic improvement on DRB and have be widely use in vitro and in vivo to gain a great understanding of the biological role of CK2 [ @card@ ] . TBI ( 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole , also know as TBBz ) be synthesise under the same condition as TBB ( Scheme 3 ) [ @card@ ] and be first discover as a CK2 inhibitor by Szyszka et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . it be later revisit as a possible CK2 inhibitor simultaneously by Andrzejewska et al . and Zień et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . TBI be find to be more active than the previous good inhibitor TBB ( Table 1 ) , as well as more selective , in particular against PK60S [ @card@ ] . a subsequent systematic structure-activity relationship study conduct on TBI and its derivative by Pagano et al . lead to the development of 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( DMAT ) [ @card@ ] , which be significantly more potent than TBB ( Table 1 ) , particularly in cell [ @card@ ] . DMAT can be synthesize in three step from 2-mercaptobenzimidazole via the complete bromination of the imidazole follow by installation of the dimethylamine functionality ( Scheme 4 ) [ @card@ ] . due to its significantly improve activity compare to TBB ( Table 1 ) , DMAT become the main ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor use after its development and analysis in the early 2000s [ @card@ ] . however , DMAT and TBI have both be show to strongly inhibit PIM1 , PIM2 , PIM3 , PKD1 , HIPK2 and DYRK1a ( all @card@ % or less residual activity with @card@ μM of inhibitor ) , as well as cyclin A/CDK2 ( ~20 % residual activity with @card@ μM of inhibitor ) . TBB be more selective toward CK2 , although it too have be find to inhibit PIM1 and PIM3 ( <10 % residual activity with @card@ μM and 1 μM of inhibitor ) [ @card@ ] . both DMAT and TBB have be widely use as inhibitor of CK2 , although it be clear that a compromise between activity and selectivity must be make when use either of these compound for biological analysis . Polyphenolic compound , such as emodin ( Figure 5 ) , be common natural product that can be isolate from a variety of plant . the first polyphenol to be identify as a CK2 inhibitor be emodin which , up until this point , be know as an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase with IC50′s of 10–20 μM [ @card@ ] . however , it be discover in @card@ that emodin be more active against CK2 ( IC50 = 2 μM , Ki = @card@ μM ) [ @card@ ] . it should be note here that some study have class polyphenols and quinone derivative as pan-assay interference compound ( PAINs ) [ @card@ ] . however , typically entire class of compound do not exhibit this behaviour , rather a select few [ @card@ ] . nevertheless , this may begin to explain the somewhat promiscuous activity of emodin . a range of study have aim to improve the polyphenolic inhibitor of CK2 , most notably identify compound 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitroxanthen-9-one ( MNX ) , 8-hydroxy-4-methyl-9-nitrobenzo[g]chromen-2-one ( NBC ) , and 3,8-dibromo-7-hydroxy-4-methylchromen-2-one ( DBC ) ( Figure 5 ) [ @card@ ] . all three compound exhibit improve activity compare to emodin as summarise in Table 2 . DBC be the most potent analogue , however , it be poorly selective . DBC be find to significantly inhibit DYRK1a , MAPKAP-K1a , MSK1 , and Prak whereas MNX and NBC be much more selective ; MNX only significantly inhibit one other enzyme , DYRK1a by @card@ % , and NBC do not inhibit any other protein by more than @card@ % [ @card@ ] . however , this study only screen the compound against a panel of around @card@ kinase and it be currently not know if they be equally selective against the rest of the kinome . MNX and NBC be test in cell and show to be equally effective at induce cell death as TBB ( DC50 = @card@ , @card@ and @card@ μM , respectively , Jurkat cell ) [ @card@ ] . another polyphenolic compound structurally relate to emodin be quinalizarin ( 1,2,5,8-tetrahydroxy-anthraquinone ) , identify as a CK2 ATP-site inhibitor through a computational screen [ @card@ ] . although structurally very similar to emodin , the activity of quinalizarin be significantly great than that of its predecessor , as show in Table 2 . in addition to its high activity , quinalizarin also display good selectivity ; when test against a panel of @card@ kinase , quinalizarin only strongly inhibit CK2 ( 7 % residual activity , 1 μM of quinalizarin ) , with no other kinase inhibit over @card@ % [ @card@ ] . finally , quinalizarin be show to successfully induce apoptosis in HEK293T cell and be faster acting than TBB [ @card@ ] . thus , it represent the most promising candidate to date from the polyphenolic class of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor . nevertheless , its activity against a large proportion of the kinome still need to be evaluate . a new series of pyrazolo-triazines be design as CK2 inhibitor by Nie et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . a co-crystal structure of CK2 with a pyrazolo-triazine , herein refer to as PT1 ( synthesis outline in Scheme 5 ) , indicate that the adenine bind site of CK2 be occupy by the pyrazolo-triazine core and the inhibitor be secure in the ATP-binding site by two hydrogen bond in the hinge region of the protein [ @card@ ] . Structure-activity relationship study on PT1 lead to the development of three lead compound , differ in the substituent on one of the phenyl ring , namely methyl piperidine ( PT2 ) , a pyrrolidinyl amide ( PT3 ) and N , N-diethylamide ( PT4 ) . all three compound have nanomolar Ki’s for CK2 but be only micromolar inhibitor of cell growth in both HCT116 and PC3 cell line when test in an MTT assay ( Table 3 ) indicate that the physicochemical property of the series require improvement to diminish this discrepancy [ @card@ ] . subsequent optimisation of the series lead to the development of a second generation of pyrazolo-triazine inhibitor , include PT5 ( Table 3 ) [ @card@ ] . the planarity of the original compound be decrease by macrocylisation with an alkyl side chain . this reduction in flatness appear to successfully aid the compound’s cellular permeability and , despite a 10-fold reduce Ki compare to the previously develop compound , PT5 display comparable growth inhibition of cell ( Table 3 ) . thus , the drop-off in activity between enzymatic and cellular assay be reduce [ @card@ ] . optimisation of the second generation’s bind affinity may lead to the development of potent and cell permeable CK2 inhibitor . however , to date , no such optimisation of constrained pyrazolo-triazines have be publish . additionally , no datum be currently available on the selectivity profile of the compound . a similar class of compound , pyrazolo-pyrimidines , be identify by Dowling et al . use a kinase-focused subset screening approach follow by structure-activity relationship study and crystallography to guide further development [ @card@ ] . this optimisation ultimately lead to the identification of a lead candidate , 7h ( herein refer to as AZ-7h ) ( Figure 6 ) , which have picomolar bind to CK2 ( Kd = @card@ pm ) and nanomolar activity in cell ( GI50 = @card@ nM , HCT116 cell ) [ @card@ ] . unfortunately , datum for direct comparison with the pyrazolo-triazine series be not available . however , the compound’s selectivity be test against a panel of @card@ kinase and AZ-7h show modest selectivity , with @card@ kinase be inhibit by >50 % , all of which be member of the CMGC family . although display limited off-target activity , AZ-7h be active in the 10–20 nM range against Dapk2 and Dapk3 [ @card@ ] . in vivo mouse study show poor oral bioavailability of AZ-7h , but therapeutic compound concentration be achieve with intravenous and intraperitoneal injection , and the compound exhibit dose-dependent tumour growth inhibition [ @card@ ] . the promising result of AZ-7h suggest that further optimisation of the pyrazolo-pyrimidine inhibitor should be strongly consider , with a focus on decrease the activity against Dapk2 and Dapk3 . CX-4945 ( also know as Silmitasertib , ClinicalTrials . Gov identifier : NCT02128282 ( access on @card@ June @card@ ) ) be develop as an orally bioavailable CK2 inhibitor in @card@ by Siddiqui-Jain et al . [ @card@ ] . its synthesis be detail in a patent by Cylene Pharmaceuticals Inc and be a 5-step route start from 3-bromoisonicotinic acid ( Scheme 6 ) [ @card@ ] . CX-4945 be a potent CK2 inhibitor ( IC50 = 1 nM , Ki = @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] and it be postulate that its strong binding affinity arise from the formation of an ionic bridge with Lys68 , in addition to hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond with the hinge region of the active site [ @card@ ] . the selectivity of CX-4945 be test against a panel of @card@ protein kinase , at a concentration 500-times great than its IC50 against CK2 , and seven kinase be find to be inhibit by over @card@ % [ @card@ ] . however , despite the observed selectivity at relatively low concentration , CX-4945 have actually be find to inhibit @card@ other kinase with nanomolar activity , include CLK2 which be inhibit more strongly than CK2α under the same condition [ @card@ ] . due to its high potency and favourable physicochemical property , CX-4945 have be use extensively as a CK2 inhibitor , despite still not display the desire selectivity [ @card@ ] . unlike AZ-7h , CX-4945 be find to be orally bioavailable ( range from 20–51 % across specie ) , represent a great advance in the field [ @card@ ] . CX-4945 have also be see to supress DNA damage repair-related element when complexed with cisplatin-like construct as a prodrug . the CX-4945-Pt(IV ) prodrugs , CX-4945-cisplatin-Cl and CX-4945-DN604-Cl , have superior cytotoxicity to both cisplatin and the improve cisplatin-analogue DN604 and they be able to reverse drug resistance [ @card@ ] . as a result of this promising behaviour , CX-4945 be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine [ @card@ ] . a structure-activity relationship study on CX-4945 lead to the development of CX-5011 and CX-5279 ( Figure 7 ) which both contain a pyrimidine ring in place of the pyridine of CX-4945 [ @card@ ] . most promisingly , both compound show a much great specificity than CX-4945 , with Gini coefficient of @card@ , @card@ and @card@ for CX-5011 , CX-5279 and CX-4945 , respectively ( panel of @card@ kinase ) ; the improve Gini coefficient represent the low activity of the compound against other protein kinase . for example , the strong inhibition of CX-4945 for PIM1 ( IC50 = @card@ nM ) be less mark for the two follow-up compound ( PIM1 IC50 = @card@ μM and @card@ μM for CX-5011 and CX-5279 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . despite these more selective derivative be identify , CX-4945 be still often see as the gold standard of CK2 inhibitor due to its high activity and promising preliminary result in clinical trial . nevertheless , its suboptimal selectivity be undesirable when a chemical probe for CK2 be need . due to the promiscuity associate with the aforementioned inhibitor , there be a number of effort ongoing to identify new series of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor . some , such as a new series of 1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indenes ( Figure 8 ) , represent novel scaffold with moderate affinity for CK2 ( micromolar IC50′s ) and present the opportunity for optimisation to develop more potent and selective derivative [ @card@ ] . other report nanomolar IC50′s in enzymatic assay , such as the 2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3-ones series of nanomolar inhibitor ( Figure 8 ) , but be yet to provide information on their selectivity , although this work be ongoing [ @card@ ] . a series of 2-aminothiazole derivative ( Figure 8 ) with submicromolar potency be originally think to be allosteric inhibitor of CK2 but be recently show by Brear et al . to actually bind in the ATP active site [ @card@ ] . of all the recently identify inhibitor , three show the most promising result : GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and SRPIN803-rev derivative ( Figure 8 ) [ @card@ ] . Oshima et al . identify GO289 in @card@ through affinity-based target deconvolution . it be synthesise in four step ( Scheme 7 ) ; three step to install the triazole ring flow by condensation of the hydrazine and a benzylic aldehyde [ @card@ ] . a structure-activity relationship study on GO289 find that the bromoguaiacol group be essential for activity whereas the para position of the substitute phenyl ring be modifiable [ @card@ ] . GO289 be show to have very good activity ( IC50 = 7 nM ) as well as high selectivity for CK2 ; the second most inhibit protein , PIM2 , be much more weakly inhibit by GO289 than CK2 ( PIM2 IC50 = @card@ μM ) . most interestingly , the X-ray crystal structure of GO289 in complex with CK2α indicate key interaction between the compound and residue which be specific to CK2 ( V66 , V116 , H160 , M163 ) , and no interaction with the highly conserve hinge region ( Figure 9 ) [ @card@ ] . most CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor , such as CX-4945 , engage with the hinge region of the protein and these interaction can compensate for the loss of hydrophobic contact between inhibitor and other protein with a V66A mutation ( e. g. , DYRK , HIPK , Pim and CLK family kinase ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , Wells et al . publish a structure-activity relationship study on a series of pyrazolo-pyrimidines base upon AZ-7h , which be discuss earlier [ @card@ ] . the lead compound develop , SGC-CK2-1 ( previously compound @card@ ) , be synthesise via acylation of the aniline follow by reduction of the nitro group and coupling with the pyrazolo-pyrimidine core ( Scheme 8 ) [ @card@ ] . SGC-CK2-1 show strong inhibition of both CK2 catalytic subunits in an intracellular nanoBRET assay on HEK-293 cell ; IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CK2α and CK2α ' , respectively while CX-4945 , for comparison , have an IC50 of @card@ nM ( CK2α ' ) in this assay . promisingly , SGC-CK2-1 exhibit much high selectivity for CK2 than CX-4945 when test against a panel of @card@ kinase ; SGC-CK2-1 inhibit three kinase > @card@ % at 1 μM ( 2 of which be CK2α and CK2α ' ) while CX-4945 inhibit @card@ kinase under the same condition [ @card@ ] . curiously , when test in both HCT-116 and U-87 MG cell in-house , SGC-CK2-1 show no antiproliferative activity ( as do also CX-4945 , unexpectedly ) while show @card@ μM and @card@ μM IC50′s for the same cell line in a @card@ cancer cell line panel . additionally , no caspase @card@ activation be observe with SGC-CK2-1 ( test up to @card@ μM ) . the author suggest that these result imply that antiproliferative activity exhibit by less selective CK2 inhibitor arise due to inhibition of off-target kinase as oppose to CK2 inhibition . as CX-4945 also show no antiproliferative activity in their cellular assay and the externally run cell panel assay result be contradictory to this , these result must be investigate further before reliable conclusion can be draw [ @card@ ] . SRPIN803 be previously identify as a dual inhibitor of SRPK1 and CK2 , although it show 10-fold great inhibition of CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ μM for CK2 and SRPK1 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the crystal structure of SRPIN803 in complex with CK2α reveal that the compound be in the open form ( the thiadiazole nitrogen have not react with the nitrile carbon as report previously ) [ @card@ ] . this lead to the rename of the open form of the compound as SRPIN803-rev for clarity . a series of derivative be subsequently synthesise ( synthetic route for lead compound be show in Scheme 9 ) and find to have moderate inhibitory activity against CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ μM for lead compound ) as well as good selectivity ( only CK2α inhibit over @card@ % at 1 μM in a 320-kinase panel ) and cellular activity ( DC50 = @card@ μM , Jurkat cell ) . these compound constitute the first CK2 inhibitor report to protrude from the active site of the protein on the top of the hinge region ( Figure @card@ ) , and it be this property which be believe to aid their selectivity [ @card@ ] . CK2 have a flexible hinge/αD region which be capable of assume a large number of conformation , the most common two in apo structure be : a closed form , which be see in the majority of protein kinase [ @card@ ] , and an open form which be very rare [ @card@ ] . the author claim that the SRPIN803-rev derivative bind to the open conformation of the hinge/αD region and that it be this binding mode which provide the superior selectivity of the series compare to the majority of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor [ @card@ ] . GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and the SRPIN803-rev derivative be the most active and selective newly identify CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor with the most complete characterisation of their binding mode and selectivity . however , all the newly identify series and scaffold represent an opportunity for the development of potent and selective chemical probe with further optimisation . it be interesting to note that half of the newly identify scaffold contain α , β-unsaturated carbonyl ( Figure 8 ) and as such may be capable of react with a variety of thiol in vivo ; thorough investigation of this reactivity should be consider before further development of these series . nevertheless , the number of newly develop series , as well as the recent success of GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and the SRPIN803-rev derivative , give hope that a highly selective chemical probe for CK2 will be obtainable with an ATP-competitive inhibitor in the near future . an alternative approach to the problem of ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor be take by Cozza et al . whereby they utilise the promiscuity of TBI towards other enzyme , specifically PIM1 . the promiscuous activity of TBI be curtail by functionalisation of the benzimidazole core with a deoxyribose moiety to form 1-(β-D-2′-deoxyribofuranosyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( TDB ) ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . unlike TBI , TDB be mostly selective for CK2 and PIM1 ( IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CK2 and PIM1 , respectively ) , although it do also inhibit CLK2 comparably ( IC50= @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] . cell testing show that the pro-apoptotic activity of TDB be superior to “ selective ” inhibitor of either CK2 or PIM1 , which the author suggest be due to the synergistic effect of simultaneous inhibition of CK2 and PIM1 . despite CX-4945 have a great in vitro potency against CK2 than TDB and similar activity against PIM1 ( CK2 IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CX-4945 and TDB , respectively ; PIM1 IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CX-4945 and TDB , respectively ) , TDB be find to be more cytotoxic than CX-4945 [ @card@ ] . Chojnacki et al . also publish research in @card@ detail an analogous series of aminoalkyl CK2/PIM1 dual inhibitor base on the structure of TBI ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . however , these compound do not have as favourable binding affinity for CK2α as those aforementioned ; TDB Ki = @card@ nM , @card@ nM ( CK2α and PIM1 , respectively ) whereas for the lead aminoalkyl-substituted derivative , Ki = @card@ nM , @card@ nM ( CK2α and PIM1 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . recently , a similar approach be take by the Ramos group , this time combine CK2 and HDAC inhibition [ @card@ ] . they combine the structure of vorinostat , a know selective HDAC inhibitor , with that of DMAT to create a series of dual CK2/HDAC inhibitor [ @card@ ] . optimisation lead to the development of a series of compound with low micromolar activity in enzymatic assay as well as low micromolar LC50 value for a variety of cell line ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the same group publish an alternative series of CK2/HDAC inhibitor in which the DMAT-derived portion of the compound be replace with the much more potent CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 . the lead compound develop , 15c ( Figure @card@ ) , exhibit significantly great inhibitory activity against CK2 and HDAC1 than the reference compound ( @card@ and @card@ time high activity than CX-4945 and vorinostat , respectively ) as well as micromolar activity in cell-based cytotoxicity assay [ @card@ ] . the development of dual functional inhibitor be still in its infancy . nevertheless , promise early result suggest that it may be a viable strategy to utilise the promiscuity of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor for maximum therapeutic effect . this approach may result in the development of highly effective anti-proliferative compound with minimal off-target effect if the promiscuous activity of the inhibitor can be limit to the desire kinase ; however , this strategy be not widely applicable for the development of chemical probe as the observed effect of the compound will depend upon the combined function of the kinase target . another method for CK2 inhibition combine both ATP- and substrate-competitive inhibitor to give bi-substrate inhibitor . Bi-substrate inhibitor be make up of two distinct moiety : typically , an ATP-site inhibit fragment for protein kinase and a motif resemble a substrate of the enzyme [ @card@ ] . these inhibitor be discuss in detail in a recent review of non-ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor and reader be redirect here for a detailed discussion [ @card@ ] . for interest , a brief overview will be provide . the first bi-substrate inhibitor successfully develop be ARC-1502 ( Figure @card@ ) , constitute the ATP-competitive inhibitor TBI bind to an acidic peptide [ @card@ ] . ARC-1502 , have a strong binding affinity for CK2α ( Ki = @card@ nM ) alongside good selectivity [ @card@ ] . however , it be not proteolytically stable or cell permeable , limit its utility [ @card@ ] . subsequently , a cell permeable and stable “ pro-drug ” be develop by use of a peptoid chain and mask of the aspartic acid side chain with acetoxymethyl ester to give ARC-1859 ( Figure @card@ ) , which be show to be active in cell [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the bi-substrate inhibitor ARC-1513-5O ( Figure @card@ ) be develop which use CX-4945 as the ATP-competitive inhibitor . despite show picomolar bind to CK2 , ARC-1513-5O show only moderate selectivity , highlight the need to use a selective ATP-site inhibit portion of the molecule to gain a selective bi-substrate inhibitor [ @card@ ] . Pietsch et al . recently develop ARC-3140 ( Figure @card@ ) which utilise tetraiodobenzimidazole as the ATP-site inhibitor . ARC-3140 have picomolar bind to CK2 but be show to also bind at two other location on CK2α [ @card@ ] . the handful of bi-substrate inhibitor develop thus far be proof that the strategy be possible . however , the compound need further development and analysis before they can be truly effective chemical probe . in particular , the selectivity profile of the compound need to be evaluate in detail . it be probable that the selectivity of the molecule will be determine by the most potent portion of the molecule . therefore , for this strategy to produce highly selective compound , the selectivity of ATP-competitive inhibitor must be enhance , or the affinity of substrate-competitive inhibitor must be increase . additionally , none of the crystal structure report to date have well define density arise from the substrate bind site portion of the molecule [ @card@ ] . overcome this issue and obtain a well-defined crystal structure for such compound would aid future development and facilitate structure-guided design . an allosteric inhibitor develop by the Hyvönen and Spring group be find to bind in the recently discover αD pocket of CK2 with a Kd of @card@ μM but no inhibition of CK2 be observe [ @card@ ] . due to the proximity of the αD pocket to the ATP-site , the compound be link to a fragment that bind weakly to the ATP-site with the rationale that selectivity for CK2 could be achieve as the majority of the binding affinity of the compound would arise from the allosteric portion of the molecule which bind in the poorly conserve αD pocket . the result compound , CAM4066 , synthesize as outline in Figure @card@ , show subnanomolar activity in enzymatic assay and low micromolar cellular activity ( Kd = @card@ nM , IC50 = @card@ nM , and a GI50 of @card@ μM ( for the methyl-ester prodrug ) ) [ @card@ ] . most promisingly , CAM4066 be show to be selective with a Gini coefficient of @card@ ( @card@ kinase panel , 2 μM CAM4066 ) [ @card@ ] . the high selectivity combine with the promising biological result of CAM4066 suggest that the unique binding mode of the molecule ( Figure @card@ ) be an effective strategy to obtain both strong inhibition of activity and selectivity amongst the kinome when develop protein kinase inhibitor and , thus , it may represent a promising design strategy to be apply to other kinase . despite their diverse and numerous role in biology , protein kinase be a tight-knit family of enzyme . this pose numerous challenge for scientist try to modulate their activity to decipher their specific role and interaction , and for pharmaceutical development . ATP-competitive inhibitor be one of the most explore set of compound via which to modulate their activity yet , due to the highly conserve nature of the ATP-active site amongst the kinome , they be often plague by poor selectivity and off-target effect . this be true for the protein kinase CK2 , for which a truly selective , highly potent and cell permeable ATP-competitive inhibitor be yet to be develop . however , continued research in the field , optimisation of exist inhibitor and the identification of novel scaffold and series of compound be provide hope that a good chemical probe will be obtain in the near future . additionally , three alternative strategy be be use to try and circumvent the issue typically observe with ATP-competitive inhibitor : dual functional inhibitor , bi-substrate inhibitor and the combination of allosteric and ATP-site inhibitor . although the field be in their infancy , all three show encourage initial result and , as such , may represent promising strategy to be apply to the modulation of a variety of other protein kinase . in this review , we have describe the challenge associate with develop ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor , utilise the kinase CK2 as an example ; downfall of historical CK2 inhibitor be highlight , alongside an overview of the new discovery in the field over the past eight year , include alternative strategy for inhibition utilise the ATP active site . although a fully selective ATP-competitive probe for CK2 have yet to be identify , recent advance in the field put the end in sight , and it be hope that the pitfall and success observe for CK2 inhibitor may provide inspiration for the development of effective modulator of other protein kinase for application in biochemistry , chemical biology and drug development .   prescription of glucose-lowering therapy and risk of COVID-19 mortality in people with type 2 diabetes : a nationwide observational study in England among the risk factor for COVID-19 mortality , type 2 diabetes have emerge as one of the most important and common.1 in a recent population-based cohort study , the risk of COVID-19 mortality be twice as high in people with type 2 diabetes as in those without ; 2 study have also show an association between hyperglycaemia and increase COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes.3 , 4 although potential direct therapeutic benefit in relation to COVID-19 have be propose , the safety of some glucose-lowering therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 have be questioned.1 the DPP-4 inhibitor have be hypothesise to potentially modify the biological activity of various substrate involve in the immune response to the infection , with suggestion of potential benefit or harm.1 , 5 it have be propose that the SGLT2 inhibitor could increase COVID-19-related risk via increase kidney expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2),6 a receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.7 similarly , GLP-1 receptor agonist have be associate with increase ACE2 expression in lung and heart tissue and with beneficial effect in acute lung injury , with suggestion of possible helpful and harmful effect in COVID-19.8 , 9 Recent study have suggest a low risk of COVID-19-related hospital mortality in people with type 2 diabetes who be prescribe metformin before hospital admission10 or sitagliptin on admission.11 Notwithstanding call for ongoing scrutiny to understand the use , risk , and benefit of individual class of glucose-lowering drug in people with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 , there be no comprehensive , comparative datum on differential effect of glucose-lowering drug on risk for severe COVID-19.5 Expert group have make consensus recommendation for glucose-lowering drug , such as to avoid metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor , because of putative risk of lactic acidosis with metformin and diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitor in patient admit to hospital with COVID-19.12 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ however , withdraw these medication could not only result in hyperglycaemia , a risk factor for poor outcome in COVID-19,3 but also increase the long-term risk of major cardiovascular event and progression of chronic kidney disease.19 Research in context evidence before this study from March 1 to Nov @card@ , @card@ , we do weekly search of PubMed and medRxiv use the search term “ COVID-19 ” , “ SARS-CoV-2 ” , “ coronavirus ” , “ SARS virus ” , and “ diabetes ” , restrict to English-language publication . small retrospective study from the USA , China , and France have all report a low or neutral risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people previously or currently prescribe metformin . a recent meta-analysis of five observational study show that the use of metformin before hospital admission in people with diabetes and sepsis ( non-COVID-19 relate ) be associate with low mortality . in a small French multicentre observational study , investigator report no association between use of sulfonylureas , meglitinides , DPP-4 inhibitor , or GLP-1 receptor agonist and COVID-19-related mortality , but high mortality associate with insulin therapy . most previous study be do at a single centre with a small number of people with type 2 diabetes , and most study investigate a small number of glucose-lowering drug . added value of this study To our knowledge , this be the large COVID-19-related population study , cover almost the entire population of people with type 2 diabetes in England . we assess the association of prescription for the follow glucose-lowering drug or drug class with COVID-related mortality : DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 receptor agonist , insulin , meglitinides , metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , sulfonylureas , thiazolidinediones , and α-glucosidase inhibitor . people with type 2 diabetes prescribed metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , and sulfonylureas have a low risk of COVID-19-related mortality and those prescribed insulin and DPP-4 inhibitor have a high risk of COVID-19 related mortality ( compare with those not prescribe these drug ) , although these finding be likely to be due to confound by indication , in view of the\n",
            "use of different drug class in the early and late stage of the type 2 diabetes disease trajectory . implication of all the available evidence our result suggest that there be no evidence to change prescribe of glucose-lowering drug in people with type 2 diabetes in clinical practice in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . in view of the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide , its high prevalence in people with COVID-19 , and the heighten of COVID-19 mortality risk by hyperglycaemia , investigate the safety of glucose-lowering drug be important for people with diabetes , clinician , and policy maker . we therefore investigate the relation between the prescription of commonly use glucose-lowering drug and COVID-19 mortality in a national cohort of people with type 2 diabetes . in particular , we aim to identify any unexpected large effect size that might have potential for recommendation about routinely use glucose-lowering drug in clinical practice . this be a nationwide observational cohort study do with datum from England . the study be do in line with the RECORD-PE guideline for conduct and report a pharmacoepidemiological study with routinely collect datum ( appendix pp 7–9 ) . the National Diabetes Audit ( NDA ) have collate datum on people with diagnose diabetes register with a health-care provider in England since @card@ these data be link via unique National Health Service ( NHS ) number to hospital episode statistic , a record of all hospital admission in England ; and to civil death registration , collate by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) . information on data approval and permission be in the appendix ( pp 1–2 ) . the study population consist of individual with type 2 diabetes include in the NDA data extraction from Jan 1 , @card@ , to March @card@ , @card@ , whose most recent general practice be in England and provide datum on prescription to the NDA , and who be alive on Feb @card@ , @card@ ( index date ) . people with an unknown date of birth or recorded date of birth give an age of @card@ year or old be exclude from the analysis . diabetes be diagnose in routine clinical care and type 2 diabetes be deduce from the clinical code record in electronic patient record and collate by the NDA . where there be code for multiple type of diabetes , the type identify by a specialist diabetes service be give precedence over that define in primary care ; where there be a discrepancy between code use in specialist service or within primary care , the late recorded type of diabetes be assume to be the most accurate . the primary exposure of interest in this analysis be prescription for the follow glucose-lowering drug or drug class : DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 receptor agonist , insulin , meglitinides , metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , sulfonylureas , thiazolidinediones , and α-glucosidase inhibitor . individual be class as be prescribe the drug or drug class if they have receive two or more prescription between July 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ . death register with on that occur between Feb @card@ , @card@ , and Aug @card@ , @card@ , be include in the analysis . death be define as COVID-19 relate if the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ; version @card@ ) code U07.1 ( COVID-19 , virus identify ) or U07.2 ( COVID-19 , virus not identify ) be record as either the primary underlie or secondary cause of death . age and duration of diagnose diabetes be calculate for the index date of Feb @card@ , @card@ . home postcode be use to identify region of residence and social deprivation status , as define by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation @card@ ethnicity be obtain from record of self-reported ethnic group during the course of routine clinical care . the most recent measurement of HbA1c , systolic blood pressure , total serum cholesterol , and creatinine record between Jan 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ , be identify . the modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula be use to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . people who have receive one or more prescription for antihypertensive drug or statins between Jan 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ , be identify from general practice prescribe record .

To our knowledge , this be the large study to examine the association of several commonly prescribe class of glucose-lowering drug with COVID-19-related mortality . in this nationally representative , population-based study of 2·85 million people with type 2 diabetes , there be statistical evidence that people prescribe metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , and sulfonylureas have a low mortality risk than those not prescribe these drug . conversely , the risk be high in those prescribed insulin and DPP-4 inhibitor than those not prescribe these drug . these finding be likely to be relate in part to confound by indication , because metformin be use early in the disease trajectory of type 2 diabetes whereas insulin be typically initiate later . furthermore , the absolute increase and decrease in risk be very small . national recommendation for use of DPP-4 inhibitor include old people and particularly those with frailty.26 The observe low risk in people prescribe SGLT2 inhibitor and sulfonylureas be likely to be relate to confound by indication and their low use in old people , particularly those with frailty , in view of increase risk of volume depletion for SGLT2 inhibitor and hypoglycaemia for sulfonylureas . NDA datum do not include information on frailty ; we be therefore unable to adjust for this variable . in exploratory subgroup analysis , we identify some difference by age and history of cardiovascular disease , although these result should be interpret with caution in view of a low statistical power and residual confounding.27 the low risk of mortality in patient who be prescribe metformin and the high risk in those prescribed insulin , have be observe previously and might be relate to residual confound by the burden of cardiorenal comorbidities and historical glycaemic burden , factor that can be fully address by statistical adjustments.10 association between insulin prescription and mortality have also be report in previous observational study and be relate to commencement of insulin at a late stage of the disease.28 , @card@ Smaller retrospective study from the USA , China , and France have all report a low or neutral risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people previously or currently prescribe metformin.10 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ in a meta-analysis of five observational study include @card@ patient , use of metformin before hospital admission in people with diabetes and sepsis ( non-COVID-19 relate ) be associate with low mortality.33 in a French multicentre observational study that include @card@ people with type 2 diabetes , investigator report no association between use of sulfonylureas , meglitinides , DPP-4 inhibitor , or GLP-1 receptor agonist and COVID-19-related mortality ; however , there be high mortality associate with insulin therapy ( odd ratio 1·71 [ @card@ % CI 1·20–2·43]).10 in one small observational study in Northern Italy of @card@ patient with type 2 diabetes who be admit to hospital with COVID-19 , a low risk of mortality be see in patient on sitagliptin than in those who receive standard of care ( HR 0·44 [ @card@ % CI 0·29–0·66]).11 although some of these finding be confirm in our analysis , we also observe several difference probably relate to dissimilarity in sample size or confound adjustment . our study have several limitation . because the medication include be prescribe in the last 6 month of @card@ , there be the possibility that some of these agent have be suspend before or on admission to hospital for COVID-19 . there be no measure of medication adherence in this study ; however , a previous report of overall adherence for most glucose-lowering therapy use an objective measure ( urine liquid chromatography ) show adherence rate for glucose-lowering medication of about @card@ moreover , the NDA do not collect datum on the dose of medication . in our analysis , we adjust for several important potential confounder , include regional difference , to reduce the risk of confound ; however , we can exclude residual confound due to imperfect adjustment for those factor we have consider , nor unmeasured confound by factor that we have not include . furthermore , during the pandemic , the reporting of COVID-19 as either the underlie cause of death or a significant contributory factor might have be inconsistent ; although it be difficult to quantify the extent or direction of any bias create by the omission of death possibly relate to COVID-19 , it be unlikely that this bias would be differential with respect to class of glucose-lowering therapy . we report association for the prescription of all class of glucose-lowering medication in people with type 2 diabetes in England ; the number of event be low for meglitinides and α-glucosidase inhibitor because these drug be not widely use in England , although they be use more extensively in some other country . give the many possible combination of glucose-lowering drug class that can be use by patient with type 2 diabetes , it be not possible to estimate the HRs for these combination ; however , this be not the main purpose of the analysis . we use the missing-category approach to maximise the size of the cohort and the statistical power ; although other approach could be apply to account for miss datum , their relative strength and limitation in the context of doubly robust adjustment with the use of propensity score as a variable be uncertain . a strength of our study be the whole-population inclusion of nearly all people diagnose with type 2 diabetes in England , include comprehensive prepandemic information on risk factor ; the result be therefore probably generalisable to the general population of people with type 2 diabetes . a further strength be the comprehensive assessment of the risk across all class of glucose-lowering drug commonly use in clinical practice—previous study be largely limit to single drug . because of provision of universal health care , with all medicine for people with diabetes available without charge in England , our result should not be bias by access to medication . many study of the risk of therapy in patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 have focus on people in hospital,10 whereas our cohort include all people with type 2 diabetes , whether or not they be admit to hospital with COVID-19 . furthermore , our outcome of all death with COVID-19 identify as a cause , in-hospital or outside of hospital , provide a robust outcome independent of clinical decision , administrative arrangement , and resource availability , which might influence decision relate to hospital or intensive care unit admission . give the nature of this study , we can infer causality from our observation . randomise clinical trial assess the role of glucose-lowering therapy would be necessary to assess any causal effect of glucose-lowering drug on COVID-19 outcome in patient with type 2 diabetes . the DARE-19 study ( NCT04350593 ) be investigate the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus placebo on the risk of death or organ dysfunction in patient admit to hospital with COVID-19 . in the MET-COVID trial ( NCT04510194 ) , the effect of metformin be be compare with placebo for both the prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection and the risk of COVID-19 disease . because neither of these study be specifically include patient with type 2 diabetes , their result will generate little evidence on the safety of these glucose-lowering drug in this patient population . however , several study with DPP-4 inhibitor ( NCT04365517 , NCT04371978 , and NCT04341935 ) be be conduct in patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 . in summary , in this study of a national cohort of 2·85 million people with type 2 diabetes , we identify a statistically low risk of COVID-19-related mortality in patient prescribe metformin and a high risk of COVID-19-related mortality in patient prescribe insulin , support finding from previous small study . we also identify a low risk with sulfonylureas and SGLT2 inhibitor and a slightly high risk with DPP-4 inhibitor . the low and high risk associate with these drug be likely to be due to residual confound rather than direct drug effect . Cardiorenal comorbidities and frailty be probable contributor to our observation and be also important COVID-19 risk factor . we interpret these finding to suggest that there be , as yet , no clear indication to jeopardise a modifiable risk factor—glucose control—or other potential glucose-independent benefit of specific drug by stop or change diabetes medication in people with type 2 diabetes in daily practice . additional study to validate these finding in large national datasets in other country be warrant . datum from the NDA can be request through the NHS Digital Data Access Request Service process . for further information , contact diabetes@nhs . net .

3]，对于COVID-19确诊患儿，如果在积极治疗后仍持续发热，可在强力广覆盖抗感染的前提下，适时适量使用激素并联合连续小剂量丙种球蛋白输注支持治疗，以抑制免疫损伤导致继发细胞因子风暴/多脏器器官功能衰竭的发生，遏制病情向危重发展。儿童COVID-19临床表现以发热和咳嗽较为常见，也可有乏力、肌痛、恶心、呕吐或腹泻等。早期肺部CT呈多发小斑片影及间质改变，以肺外带明显，进而发展为双肺多发磨玻璃影或浸润影，严重者可出现肺实变，胸腔积液少见，轻症病例可以无明显病变[4]。而恶性血液病患儿化疗后粒缺合并发热病情复杂，治疗难度大于一般COVID-19患者。本例患儿平时基本居家生活，1月13日乘坐武汉市内公共交通来院化疗，截止到1月19日化疗结束均在病房层流床内。住院期间除陪护家长外，未与其他患儿或家属亲密接触。期间陪护家长也无发热、咳嗽等不适。患儿在接受化疗后10 d出现发热，但其父母以及住院时同病房人群均无COVID-19相关接触史，也无发热、咳嗽等临床症状，COVID-19核酸检测结果均阴性。且患儿的相关实验室检查均未见异常，仅肺部CT提示右中叶肺部实变，我们首先考虑为化疗后粒缺合并发热，并按照相关临床诊疗指南予对应治疗[5]。此后甲型流感病毒检测阳性，但口服奥司他韦并无明显改善，再次复查肺部CT发现肺部病灶进展，并结合目前疫情，加做2019-nCoV核酸检测最终明确诊断。由于该患儿无明确流行病学接触史，我们推测该患儿可能就医途中感染。 本例患儿发热第11天2019-nCoV核酸阳性，但发热第5天肺部CT已可观察到病灶，提示影像学结合病原学检查的重要性。患儿于发热第16天（2月12日）、第18天（2月14日）、第21天（2月17日）2019-nCoV核酸结果分别为阳性、阴性、阳性，提示对于白血病患儿化疗后骨髓抑制期感染2019-nCoV，若临床好转不明显（比如仍有持续发热、咳嗽症状加重等），有必要动态监测核酸以评估2019-nCoV病毒负荷，同时咽拭子核酸检测存在假阴性可能，一次转阴并不能代表病毒得到控制。本例患儿发病至今将近3周时间，2019-nCoV核酸仍未转阴，比邓慧玲等[6]报道的一般患儿转阴时间长，可能是ALL患儿合并COVID-19的特征。此外该例患儿发病初期铁蛋白即异常升高，是否与患儿体温控制不佳，临床疗效不好有关值得关注。 既往SARS冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）感染中，细胞因子风暴是重要的致死原因[7]。陈蕾等[8]分析29例成人COVID-19患者细胞因子水平，危重患者IL-2R与IL-6水平明显升高。而本例患儿的细胞因子水平仅仅IL-6有轻度升高，IL-2始终稳定在正常范围内。因此COVID-19患儿糖皮质激素的使用时机和用量应有别于成人病例。 COVID-19疫情期间避免血液肿瘤疾病患儿发生院内感染[9]，尤其是避免化疗后粒缺患儿的院内感染尤为重要。结合本病例的诊治经验，我们建议：（1）对于已获得完全缓解的白血病儿童，尽可能避免强化疗，可以口服巯嘌呤/甲氨蝶呤维持治疗，以降低感染风险。（2）为避免病区内感染暴发，儿童血液肿瘤病房必须严格落实医院感染管理制度和消毒隔离制度，严格执行预检分诊、有序预约入院化疗并控制陪护家长。对于疑似COVID-19感染的血液肿瘤患儿应立即按照相关防治指南进行分级诊断和分层管理。   Correction to : the Post-Pandemic World : between Constitutionalized and Authoritarian Orders – China’s Narrative-Power Play in the Pandemic Era Correction to : Journal of Chinese Political Science . 10.1007/s11366-020-09695-3 the original version of the article miss to add two reference concern method add to the main text and in the reference list . follow be the change on page 3 of the original version as well as the detail of the two missing reference . the subsequent reference citation be also adjust accordingly in the original version . in term of method , this article will rely on a two-level document analysis of state document , policy speech , newspaper , magazine article and ( social ) medium account [ 8 ] . the first level involve a systematic review of news article , journal and literature on Chinese narrative power and change world order . with insight derive from this review , relate primary document such as official statement , speech , policy proposal , and interview deliver by government/officials/media outlet ( particularly relevant to the COVID-19 crisis ) will be investigate [ 8 ] . besides this , social medium ( Twitter , YouTube , et cetera ) will be use as an auxiliary resource because the pandemic be a current and ongoing issue and the role of social medium in narrative discussion should not be ignored.1 then the second level , the discourse analysis , will be integrate with knowledge derive from the first level to establish the “ interweave link between the text and the…contexts ” ( [ 8 , 9]:1756 ) . the original article have be correct .   a rapid and reliable liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method for SARS-CoV-2 analysis from gargle solution and saliva the COVID-19 pandemic be one of the big challenge of our time . during the past @card@ year , we have see a rapid spread of the disease with increase number of infection and fatality . the number be so dynamic that it be difficult to pencil them in exact count as be they be obsolete within hour . To date , there have be more than @card@ million of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close to 3 million of fatality worldwide [ 1 ] , with ~120 million of infected individual have recover and ~ @card@ million of vaccine dose administered.1 an infection with SARS-CoV-2 do not necessarily lead to serious health problem ; often , the patient do not experience any symptom . this be one of the great challenge when deal with SARS-CoV-2 , make it one of the most contagious and successfully spread virus . therefore , reliable diagnostic tool allow a rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 be of enormous importance . currently , the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic be reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR ) . despite its strength , RT-qPCR also suffer a number of drawback [ 2 ] . at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early @card@ , the big challenge be the availability of high-throughput tool to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection . this have be successfully address by the development of cost-efficient , ready-to-use antigen detection test , which have become broadly available [ 3 ] . another important issue that need to be deal with be the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 mutation that have to be detect in routine diagnostic [ 4 ] . mass spectrometry ( Ms ) have already be spot in April @card@ as a valuable complementary method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic from gargle solution of COVID-19 patient [ 5 ] . in the meantime , the potential of MS have become evident [ 6 ] and numerous report on SARS-CoV-2 identification by MS method have be publish since the beginning of the pandemic [ 7–11 ] . in the present work , we describe our late effort in develop a rapid liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic from gargle solution and saliva . we report an MS-compatible sample preparation strategy and a quantification protocol that be base on selected peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by an LC-multiple-reaction monitoring ( MRM)-MS/MS approach . for LC-MS/MS method development , two sample types—gargle solution and saliva—were employ . gargle solution be collect from six healthy individual by gargle with @card@ mL of isotonic ( @card@ % ( w/v ) ) NaCl solution for @card@ s. Saliva sample be directly collect from three healthy individual by spit ~1 mL of saliva into a 50-mL tube . in initial experiment , our original sample preparation procedure [ 5 ] be employ , add 1 mL of acetone ( −20 °C ) to @card@ μL of gargle solution . after store the sample at −20 °C overnight , sample be centrifuge ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) , and the protein pellet be digest use the Smart Digest ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) protocol with immobilize trypsin bead . in further experiment , we optimize sample preparation in respect to short preparation time , high sensitivity , and improve compatibility with RT-qPCR by use TRIZOL reagent ( @card@ mL of solution contain @card@ g guanidinium thiocyanate , @card@ g ammonium thiocyanate , @card@ mL 3 M sodium acetate , 5 g glycerol , @card@ mL Roti Aqua-Phenol ( Roth ) ) for protein denaturation . a total of @card@ μL of TRIZOL reagent be add to @card@ μL of saliva and the solution be load on centrifugation filter unit ( Amicon , @card@ kDa molecular weight cutoff , Millipore ) . afterwards , the filter unit be treat accord to the follow filter-aided sample preparation ( FASP ) protocol : filter unit be wash twice with @card@ μL of @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate , follow by centrifugation ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) and incubate at @card@ °C for 2 h with trypsin ( Promega ) ( 1 μg in @card@ μL of @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate ) . tryptic peptide be collect by add @card@ μL of @card@ M NaCl , follow by a centrifugation step ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) . after add @card@ μL of @card@ % ( v/v ) trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , sample volume be adjust to @card@ μL , before the sample be subject to LC-MS/MS analysis . Four selected synthetic peptide derive from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein ( Arg41-Lsy61 , Arg41-Lys65 , Met210-Arg226 , and Met210-Lys233 ) and their heavy isotope ( 13C and 15N)-labeled variant ( Arg41-Lsy*61 , Arg41-Lys*65 , Met210-Arg*226 , and Met210-Lys*233 , SpikeTide-TQL peptide , where * denote [ 13C615N4]-Arg or [ 13C615N2]-Lys ) be purchase from JPT Peptide Technologies and use for method development and as quantitation standard . LC separation of peptide be perform on a UPLC I-Class FTN system ( Waters ) equip with a BEH C18 column ( @card@ mm. × @card@ mm. , @card@ μm , Waters ) . the UPLC system be directly couple to a Xevo TQ-XS mass spectrometer ( Waters ) equip with electrospray ionization ( ESI ) source . MS acquisition be perform use an MRM method of two selected transition per peptide with optimize collision energy . Isotope-labeled peptide ( see above ) be dilute in @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate to concentration between 5 amol/μL and @card@ fmol/μL and digest with trypsin . Isotope-labeled peptide be spike at different concentration ( @card@ to @card@ fmol/μL ) to gargle solution sample after tryptic digestion ( Smart digestion protocol ) . alternatively , isotope-labeled peptide be spike at the same concentration ( @card@ to @card@ fmol/μL ) to saliva sample after tryptic digestion ( TRIZOL/FASP protocol ) . the obtain result serve to determine the limit of detection ( Lod ) and the limit of quantitation ( LOQ ) of our LC-MS/MS method . the aim of our LC-MS/MS method development be to obtain highly sensitive detection and accurate quantitation of the tryptic peptide Arg41-Lsy61 , Arg41-Lys65 , Met210-Arg226 , and Met210-Lys233 from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . it have to be note that these peptide exhibit low ionization efficiency compare to other tryptic peptide in the digestion mixture of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . additionally , they be challenge for MS analysis due to their size and charge . we still select these specific SARS-CoV-2 peptide as they be recently show to be generate from authentic material of infected patient [ 5 ] . the two peptide start with Arg41 be specific for a group of coronaviruses , while the two peptide start with Met210 be unique for SARS-CoV-2 . Methionine-containing peptide be not ideally suit for LC-MS/MS quantitation as they might undergo oxidation process . however , we be able to monitor oxidation product with our synthetic peptide standard and observe only <3 % of Met-oxidized variant ( datum not show ) . we therefore feel confident to include the respective Met-containing peptide in our experiment . we seek to achieve the high possible sensitivity , together with short run time in a robust setup that might be use in a clinical routine environment . first , we have to switch from our initial nano-HPLC setup ( @card@ nL/min ) with an LC time of more than 3 h [ 5 ] to a normal-flow UPLC setup . the most important constraint be to achieve a baseline LC separation of the four peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify previously in gargle sample [ 5 ] . for this , we apply the LC gradient as display in Fig . 1 with a total cycle time of 5 min . it should be note that short LC-MS/MS cycle time be crucial for conduct medium- to high-throughput analysis in MS-based SARS-CoV-2 routine diagnostic . while sample preparation can be parallelize enable hundred of sample to be process at the same time , LC-MS/MS sample throughput rely on short cycle time and the number of available mass spectrometer . consequently , LC-MS/MS cycle time of 5 min allow @card@ sample per hour ( @card@ sample per day ) to be analyze on each instrument . another important aspect to be consider for LC-MS/MS analysis in a clinical setting be a low sample carryover from injection to injection . carryover between sample be reduce in our setup to non-detectable amount by use @card@ % ( v/v ) TFA as purge solution and @card@ % ( v/v ) formic acid plus @card@ % ( v/v ) TFA in water/acetonitrile ( @card@ ( v/v ) ) as wash solution of the UPLC system ( datum not show ) . next , we have to move from the high-resolution mass spectrometer ( Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid ) that have be employ in our previous study [ 5 ] to a quadrupole instrument of the high sensitivity . sensitivity be one of the key point for develop MS-based , reliable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic method as viral protein be directly detect . this stand in contrast to RT-qPCR that rely on the amplification of the virus ' genetic material . therefore , the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 be directly relate to the sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS method . the most sensitive method use triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer be MRM scan . MRM be a targeted method that have to be specifically optimize for each analyte by evaluate the optimum condition for collisional activation and thereby identify the most abundant and characteristic fragment ion . as outline above , optimization of our LC-MS/MS method be base on synthetic variant of four peptide derive from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify in our previous study [ 5 ] . for these four peptide , we identify the most suitable MRM transition and collision energy with two transition per peptide ( Table 1 ) . we also add MRM transition of selected tryptic peptide from other abundant protein present in our sample and monitor them during the optimization process for sample preparation ( see below ) . all four synthetic SARS-CoV-2 peptide be employ as heavy isotope ( 13C and 15N)-labeled version ( SpikeTide-TQL peptide ) that be add to the sample solution to allow for an accurate detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 peptide . heavy isotope-labeled peptide only differ in the mass of precursor and fragment ion , but yield identical fragmentation pattern as the non-labeled SARS-CoV-2 peptide upon collisional activation in the MRM approach . also , the chromatographic behavior of non-labeled and label peptide be identical . therefore , MRM chromatogram of the synthetic heavy isotope-labeled peptide can only be use for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in patient sample , but will also exclude the assignment of false positive in highly complex matrix . in further experiment , we then use our established LC-MS/MS method for optimize sample preparation . the peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify in our previous study [ 5 ] comprise amino acid sequence Arg41-Lys65 and Met210-Lys233 . these peptide contain one miss cleavage site each as our initial digestion procedure be apparently incomplete . the respective SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide without miss cleavage site be compose of amino acid sequence Arg41-Lsy61 and Met210-Arg226 . the optimize sample preparation ( see below ) now allow a complete enzymatic digestion , yield peptide Arg41-Lsy61 and Met210-Arg226 from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . for that reason , we only employ isotope-labeled SpikeTide-TQL peptide Arg41-Lsy*61 and Met210-Arg*226 in all follow experiment . SpikeTide-TQL peptide be extend by a C-terminal tag for enhanced solubility and photometric quantitation that be remove during tryptic digestion . it be not possible to directly add these peptide to gargle solution or saliva as the peptide do not precipitate and will not be retain use centrifugation filter device with a molecular weight cutoff value of @card@ kDa . therefore , isotope-labeled peptide be add after tryptic digestion in all experiment . Figure 2A display the Lod and LOQ of Arg41-Lsy*61 and Met210-Arg*226 isotope-labeled peptide ( see “ experimental section ” ) that have be digest with trypsin in @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate without add protein matrix . both Lod and LOQ be determine to be low than @card@ amol/μL . in further experiment , isotope-labeled peptide be spike to protein pellet of gargle solution before the Smart digestion protocol [ 5 ] be apply . Figure 2B display a dramatic decrease in sensitivity and reproducibility for the SARS-CoV-2 peptide upon add a protein matrix , underline the need to optimize sample preparation . improve our sample preparation protocol include sample collection , sample homogeneity , sample concentration , and sample preparation time . in principle , nasopharyngeal swab , gargle solution , and saliva be suit to detect SARS-CoV-2 [ 5 , 11–13 ] . a number of challenge regard non-MS-compatible contamination have be report for swab sample [ @card@ ] , where the sample volume be usually less than @card@ μL . additionally , the quantitative reproducibility of swab sample collection be a matter of debate [ @card@ ] , make gargle solution a true alternative for sample collection instead of the commonly use nasopharyngeal swab sample . Saliva of COVID-19 patient should contain even high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 particle than gargle solution and as saliva be easy to collect , sample quality should be highly reproducible . conclusively , we consider saliva to be the optimum sample for a reproducible and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and focus our sample preparation optimization on saliva sample . Saliva be a complex matrix make sample preparation challenge . also , handle and inactivate presumably infectious saliva sample be an issue that require special attention during method development . first , @card@ μL of saliva be treat with TRIZOL reagent for a complete dissolution of all sample component . TRIZOL reagent be typically use for RNA preparation [ @card@ , @card@ ] and present one of the most potent protein denaturant . it allow a rapid and complete inactivation of RNases , therefore enable the isolation of intact RNA from cell lysates . treat our sample with TRIZOL reagent lead to homogenous solution and be therefore compatible with our FASP protocol for efficient washing and tryptic digestion of protein . the pellet originate from acetone precipitation , as use in our previous study [ 5 ] , be sometimes find to be incompletely dissolve in Smart digest buffer . further advantage of the TRIZOL treatment be the direct availability of the sample as no overnight protein precipitation step be need , and the possibility to split sample for parallel analysis by LC-MS/MS and RT-qPCR . the TRIZOL/FASP protocol be compatible with add the isotope-labeled peptide after tryptic digestion have be perform . strikingly , the observed LOD/LOQ value ( Fig . 2C ) be comparable to value obtain without protein matrix ( Fig . 2A ) . One initial finding when optimize the TRIZOL/FASP protocol be the detection of high amount of cytoskeletal keratin in a number of saliva sample . therefore , we add four specific MRM transition for highly abundant keratin peptide ( Table 1 ) and monitor their detection . apparently , keratin contain in the saliva sample be efficiently remove by a simple centrifugation step before apply the FASP protocol and tryptic digestion . we speculate that without centrifugation , the TRIZOL reagent completely dissolve the keratin-containing cell in the saliva make them accessible for a subsequent tryptic digestion . this additional simple centrifugation step of saliva sample will not interfere with the overall sample preparation procedure . nevertheless , there be a slight chance that virus particle might be attach to cell contain in saliva , which will then be remove by centrifugation . for that reason , we test the influence of keratin on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide . interestingly , neither Lod nor LOQ value be negatively affect by the presence of high amount of keratin peptide in the sample ( Fig . 3 ) . on the other hand , load very low protein amount ( below 1 μg ) on the centrifugation filter device result in a loss of spiked SARS-CoV-2 peptide , which be probably cause by protein and peptide bind to the membrane of the filter unit . a minimum protein load of 1 μg per filter unit be obtain from treat @card@ μL of saliva with TRIZOL . additionally , sample loading might be increase to further improve sensitivity , albeit at the cost of long sample preparation time . it be important to note that neither sample reduction nor alkylation step be perform in our digestion protocol as the respective SARS-CoV-2 peptide do not contain cysteine residue and proteolytic accessibility of these peptide be not restrict by disulfide bond . in conclusion , the overall time for sample preparation can be reduce to less than 3 h and can be perform in a highly parallelize fashion . therefore , the direct use of saliva in combination with our optimize TRIZOL/FASP protocol should improve both sample collection and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection . it have be demonstrate that @card@ genome , i. e. , DNA plasmids [ @card@ ] , can be detect in a volume of @card@ μL with cycle time ( ct ) of @card@ in RT-qPCR experiment . a RT-qPCR detection with a ct value of @card@ would require the presence of @card@ genome equivalent in @card@ μL . calculation with @card@ molecule of nucleoprotein per SARS-CoV-2 virus particle [ @card@ ] result in a nucleoprotein concentration of ~520 amol/μL , correspond to a ct value of @card@ [ @card@ ] . in our experiment , we use @card@ μL of saliva and generate @card@ μL of sample solution for LC-MS/MS analysis . under these condition , the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide would be @card@ amol/μL , which be above our estimated LOD/LOQ of ~500 amol/μL ( see above ) . it should be note that this reflect the most conservative analytical calculation . it be likely that a “ real-world ” RT-qPCR experiment be less sensitive than the one perform under the ideal condition describe in [ @card@ ] as RNA recovery be rarely complete . therefore , RT-qPCR experiment with specific ct value would be base on high virus number , result in de facto high nucleoprotein concentration . patient sample from our early study [ 5 ] exhibit ct value of @card@ and we be able to detect peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein with a nano-HPLC-nano-ESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS approach . in direct comparison , our previous LC-MS/MS method be find to be less sensitive than the LC-MS/MS approach we describe herein ( datum not show ) . therefore , we be confident to assume that ct value of high than @card@ will easily be obtain with our new LC/MRM-MS method . the sensitivity of our LC/MRM-MS approach be likely to be further improve by use high sample amount , i. e. , @card@ or @card@ μL of saliva , and by enrich the tryptic SARS-CoV-2 peptide during sample preparation . we successfully develop an LC-MS/MS method base on an MRM approach that can be use for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva sample . our approach be complementary to RT-qPCR method and exist antigen test , and can be use in a routine clinical environment where quadrupole mass spectrometer be available . sample preparation time be less than 3 h and sample handling can be parallelize for hundred of sample ( both similar to RT-qPCR ) . LC-MS/MS analysis time of our method be only 5 min , allow selected SARS-CoV-2 peptide to be detect and quantify at concentration as low as @card@ amol/μL . this concentration of SARS-CoV-2 peptide be obtain by digest @card@ μL of saliva from infected patient with RT-qPCR ct value of @card@ . even high ct value will be achieve if SARS-CoV-2 peptide enrichment be enrich by antibody . in general , LC-MS/MS method exhibit an improve quantitation accuracy compare to RT-qPCR as no amplification ( @card@ to @card@ time ) of the analytes be involve . it be still a matter of debate if/how different sample collection protocol influence SARS-CoV-2 detection . MRM-MS-based method could fill this gap and allow deliver more precise and accurate quantitative datum for a direct comparison between different method . the outstanding advantage of LC/MRM method be their potential to detect SARS-CoV2 mutation . the vast majority of amino acid exchange will result in mass shift that be easily detect by Ms , but there will probably be no drastic change in the physicochemical property of the respective SARS-CoV-2 peptide , such as ionization efficiency and fragmentation pattern . virus mutation can be easily monitor by adapt select MRM transition use simple mathematical calculation and by synthesize novel SARS-CoV-2 standard peptide . conclusively , we consider the development of novel method to be of outstanding importance to tackle some of the most urgent issue of the COVID-19 pandemic . it seem out of question that fight this pandemic urgently require interdisciplinary collaboration between virologist , clinician , and analytical chemist .   COVID-19 — the Long Road to Recovery in view of the multiple complication associate with “ long Covid ” it be essential that during recovery old person be carefully follow by physician and other health professional . it be important to recognize that symptom fluctuate and may go away for a few day and then return . there be a need for an integrated interprofessional care model to obtain the optimum recovery after COVID-19 ( @card@ ) . the key to a good recovery be an exercise program adjust to the ability of the patient to perform it . as have be show by Izquierdo and his colleague , these program should be start in hospital and continued follow hospital ( 35–37 ) . the ViviFrail exercise program be ideally adapt to do this . also , it be essential that while in the Intensive Care Unit , patient receive as much exercise as possible ( @card@ ) . these include respiratory exercise , passive joint motion , stretch , electrical stimulation of muscle , stand at bedside and walk where possible ( @card@ ) . on discharge the exercise program should include respiratory , resistance , aerobic and balance exercise as well as a focus on make sure the activity of daily live can be adequately carry out . in view of the fatigue , exercise may need to be spread out during the day . speech therapy may need to help person who have be ventilate to regain adequate speech pattern . in addition , they can work with occupational therapy to provide a variety of form of cognitive stimulation therapy in those who have have a decline in their cognition ( @card@ , @card@ ) . dietetics need to work on create taste enhancement of food in those who have lose their sense of taste and smell . person with sarcopenia or cachexia need supplementation with 10–15g/kg/day of leucine enrich essential amino acid ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in view of the social isolation that occur during the Covid epidemic it be important that program be develop to provide socialization ( @card@ , @card@ ) . this can include telehealth program such as the “ Circle of Friends ” as enhanced use of social medium ( @card@ ) . Care should be take to screen for dysphoria/depression and provide psychological therapy when it occur ( @card@ ) . it be suggest that at discharge from hospital and at 3 month discharge from hospital all COVID-19 patient be screen for frailty with the FRAIL test ( 48–51 ) , sarcopenia with the SARC-F ( 52–55 ) , anorexia with the SNAQ ( @card@ , @card@ ) and cognitive failure with the Rapid Cognitive Screen ( RCS ) ( @card@ ) . these test be simply combine into the Rapid Geriatric Assessment ( @card@ , @card@ ) and be available in an App form ( @card@ ) . person who screen positive and need to receive appropriate therapy which need to be provide free to the individual . “ Long Covid ” be an important condition which can respond to an interprofessional team approach . its fluctuation can be frustrate both for the patient and the health care provider . an additional factor that need to be take into account be whether , in the long term , chronic subclinical chronic inflammation may lead to accelerate aging both in the periphery and as a neurodegenerative process ( @card@ , @card@ ) ?   Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency : home therapy over the last few month , the SARS-CoV2 pandemic have have an impact on chronic therapy in patient with rare disease , such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) . augmentation therapy with exogenous AAT be the only specific therapy for the lung disease associate with AATD . the biochemical and clinical efficacy of AAT therapy have be well establish in numerous studies–a dose of @card@ mg/kg per week ( Chapman et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . unfortunately , during the period of emergency , some patient have difficulty access the hospital structure for chronic therapy . this be because hospital be limit access due to pandemic reorganization and because patient with lung disease be fragile and would have a potentially high risk for contract a severe SARS-CoV2 infection . a recent study describe that withdrawal of therapy in @card@ compromise AATD patient be associate with poor health outcome as demonstrate by an increase mean ( ±standard error ) number of exacerbation per patient ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ , p = @card@ ) and an increase in the mean number of hospitalization in the same patient ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ , p = @card@ ) compare to the same period in the previous year ( Gazzettaufficiale , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . To avoid the abrupt cessation of augmentation therapy , it have be necessary to activate a home treatment , which be in use in only a few EU country . in Italy , even though home therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin have be authorize since @card@ ( Gazzettaufficiale , @card@ ) , it be still an unimplemented practice . home therapy for such patient should be part of the Italian long-term care system . however , due to the system’s complexity , systemic problem regard the offer of care and eligibility of service can occur owe to the lack of integration between region ' and Municipalities ' health policy . AADT augmentation therapy have be demonstrate to be well-tolerated and generally safe . few and generally mild side effect have be report and rarely require major intervention or interruption of therapy . some author describe side effect typical of intravenous infusion of protein , include delayed fever resolve spontaneously over @card@ h , urticaria , nausea , fatigue and dizziness . dyspnea , probably relate to absolute protein load in the infusion , flu-like symptom , and , rarely , anaphylactic shock have also be describe . no death relate to AATD augmentation therapy be report ( Wencker et al . , @card@ ; Stoller et al . , @card@ ) . adverse event commonly occur during the first administration . initial alpha one antitrypsin administration be recommend in a hospital setting and in the presence of experienced operator . currently , there be no literature about the outcome of safety and quality of life of AATD patient in home treatment . To reduce patient flow to the hospital and prevent human infection , AATD home therapy be activate for @card@ patient use a specific patient support program , a home care project , already activate independently throughout Italy . the program allow patient to infuse intravenous augmentation therapy at home by qualified nurse in continuous contact with the refer physician . fourteen patient in treatment for over one year and two patient with recent treatment initiation be place in patient support program . the procedure involve in administer home-based intravenous therapy with AATD be the same as in the hospital . an experienced nurse wear adequate personal protective equipment measure the vital sign , then proceed to prepare the therapy to be administer . the therapy be administer intravenously accord to the schedule . the operator remain at the patient 's home throughout the administration . in the end , the vital parameter be check again and , finally , the venous access remove . the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) be not use in all its length . we use a modify Quality of Life ( QoL ) score for our questionnaire , consist of six question ( Table 1 ) , to analyze the general state of health , subjective symptom of the patient and impact of therapy on the patient 's and family life . To date , no validate questionnaire be available to assess QoL in patient with AATD . All the individual value be define base on a 5-point scale : 1 ) many time a day/very much ; 2 ) every day/much ; 3 ) two or three time a week/not much ; 4 ) once a week/few time ; and 5 ) rarely or never/not at all . there be also a blank space where the patient could leave a comment about their experience of home therapy . the QoL score be calculate as the sum of the point obtain from question . the minimum possible score be 6 , the maximum @card@ . we compare QoL score for each patient at time zero ( during the last hospital administration session ) and after 3 month of home therapy . patient give their written informed consent and all datum be collect anonymously . a nurse experience in support patient with AATD supervise the completion of the questionnaire . written comment from patient be also record . we survey the comment to understand what be the advantage or disadvantage of home treatment perceive by the patient . the observation time be 3 month ; however , treatment be continue at home for all patient . for statistical analysis student 's t-test be use for the continuous variable . all statistical analyze be perform with SPSS ( version @card@ ; SPSS Inc. Chicago , Il , United States of America ) and p < @card@ be consider significant . Median age ( min-max ) be @card@ year ( 26–78 ) , there be seven female and nine male . ( table 2 ) all patient continue home treatment without interruption . the same nurse support the patient at time zero and after three month , the questionnaire be administer , on both occasion , on the day schedule for replacement therapy . during the observation time , no adverse event occur . All the questionnaire complete at 3 month show an increase in score compare to the questionnaire complete during the last hospital administration session . the quality of life have improve from an index of @card@ ± @card@ at the start time ( t0 ) to an index of @card@ ± @card@ after 3 month ( t3 ) . ( Figure 1 ) the variation be statistically significant ( p < @card@ ) . for all patient , the score of the symptom control question ( “ I cough ” , “ I bring up phlegm ” , “ I have shortness of breath ” , “ I have attack of wheeze ” ) be unchanged . instead , all sixteen patient , when ask \" my ( augmentation ) therapy interfere with my life \" , answer \" very much \" or \" much \" at time zero , and “ few time ” or \" not at all \" after three month . also , to the question \" my respiratory disease be a nuisance to my family , friend or neighbor ? \" the same patient respond \" very much \" or \" much \" at time zero and \" few time \" or \" not at all \" after three month . Seven patient provide written comment . Three explain that the advantage of home therapy be to be independent of a family member or friend who have to accompany them to the hospital . Three other write that they could undergo home therapy without lose working or university day . these patient reported be very stress while go to the hospital to undergo intravenous therapy . this be especially true for patient who live far away from the hospital . only one patient report feel safe when he be treat at the hospital than at home because he feel he be monitor more carefully . augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin slow disease progression ( Chapman et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) and discontinuation of treatment be associate with poor health outcome , increase number of exacerbation and hospitalization ( Alkins and O’Malley , @card@ ; Sclar et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . some study conclude that augmentation therapy be a cost-effective strategy for manage AATD patient with COPD ( Alkins and O’Malley , @card@ ; Sclar et al . , @card@ ) . an observational study among Spanish patient also show that these patient experience a significant decrease in hospitalization cost and incidence of exacerbation follow the start of augmentation therapy ( Barros-Tizón et al . , @card@ ) . despite the know benefit , some patient have difficulty start treatment or continue it . in a recent publication , the most frequently report practical difficulty with AATD infusion be infusion time , frequency of infusion , overbooked outpatient clinic , and treatment provide by only one center . many patient also find it difficult to reach the hospital because they reside far away . clinician , try to improve the convenience of AATD patient in therapy , often consider alternative dose strategy ( bi-weekly dose ) ; reason for this consideration include coverage of holiday and individual in full-time employment ( Horváth et al . , @card@ ) . Self-administration be not viable for all patient and the safety issue surround intravenous administration be the main disadvantage . home therapy be a possible strategy , available in a few country . it be the only treatment option in Ireland and France ; in Poland , regular treatment be provide at home or be available at hospital outpatient clinic ( Horváth et al . , @card@ ) . during the COVID-19 pandemic , the difficulty in access therapy be accentuate by the reduce access to hospital and the need to preserve fragile patient , therefore the patient support program be activate to avoid the interruption of therapy that many patient would have incur . all patient adhere to the home care support program and continued treatment without interruption and side effect . the quality of life measure with a short questionnaire show a positive change after three month of home therapy . the patient report being less stress undergo treatment at home , burden less on their family and friend , and feel less interference with their personal and family life . it should also be consider that some patient lose day of work or study to carry out the therapy at the hospital , while at home it can be carry out before or after work/study . our result highlight that the home care of AATD patient , who need augmentation therapy , contribute to the optimal\n",
            "care and improvement of the patient ' quality of life . again , a home-based administration be safe and demonstrate no side effect . accord to the result of other study , home care be also practicable for several year ( Wilke et al . , @card@ ) . limitation of the study be the use of a reduce version of the SGRQ currently not validate and the small number of patient . in our study , we take advantage of a free patient support program to allow patient to continue therapy at home , the cost of the specific patient support program be fully bore by Grifols Italy . consequently , the cost for the public health system be zero . however , due to the little diffusion of home therapy , to date , there be no study that compare the cost of the hospital with home assistance . in conclusion , convenience for the patient be view as the most important advantage of home treatment . the quality of life of our patient be the main objective , especially in the case of people with rare disease with progressive deterioration of daily living . large study be need to evaluate the impact on the quality of life of home therapy , the sustainability of the cost of a home treatment , the advantage in term of work day save for the patient and for the caregiver .   prevalence and severity of depression , anxiety , stress and perceive stress in hospitalize patient with COVID-19 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) be the cause of the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease-19 ( COVID-19 ) , which be associate with the ability to transmit the disease from human to human . the disease be associate with serious health problem and can be fatal [ 1 ] . as some author have suggest , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) cause by coronavirus , as the first outbreak of an infectious disease in the 21st century , be not the last one and COVID-19 be introduce as a pandemic earlier this century [ 2 ] . the outbreak be describe by the World Health Organization as Public Health Emergency of International concern ( PHEIC ) [ 3 ] . the disease have , in recent time , be associate with social disruption and worry economic consequence . these point , along with the risk of stigmatization and discrimination , can lead to mental health disorder for public and especially in patient with the disease [ 4–6 ] . with the increase in the number of infected patient and their death , many patient may experience psychological distress and physical problem [ 7 ] . unpredictability and uncertainty of the disease condition of different aspect of epidemiology and effective method of treatment , put people expose to stressful situation [ 8 ] . fear of the consequence of a deadly disease , combine with severe anxiety and mental distress , which can coincide with insomnia and the physical effect of the disease , can create unfavorable condition for patient due to the aggravation of mental health disorder [ 9–11 ] . early in the SARS epidemic , hospitalize patient raise concern such as fear , loneliness , fatigue , and anger . they experience anxiety as a result of fever and the effect of insomnia . [ @card@ ] . anxiety be see as a significant effect of epidemic with high level of involvement and risk of death , both among people who be directly involve in the disease and among the mass . this can be accompany by depression and other psychological problem [ @card@ ] . Duan et al . , note that the epidemic of disease can have negative effect on individual , emphasize the existence of psychological distress follow the spread of the COVID-19 and the need for active and appropriate intervention in this area [ @card@ ] . in this regard Zheng note the high prevalence of psychiatric disorder among survivor of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic , include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , and emphasize the importance of prevention , screening and treatment of associate psychiatric disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic [ @card@ ] . in this study , we examine the mental health status of patient with COVID-19 who be hospitalize . after become clinically stable , these patient be evaluate for some psychiatric symptom such as depression , anxiety , stress , and perceive stress . this study also have investigate the possible impact of occupational , economic and social status of patient on their mental health follow the spread of COVID-19 . examin the impact of demographic difference such as marital status in this area be another point of discussion . due to the interaction of some underlie disease such as hypertension and diabetes and psychiatric disorder [ @card@ , @card@ ] , in this study , we also investigate the relationship between these disease and related psychiatric disorder in patient with COVID-19 . this study be a cross-sectional study conduct in one of the large referral center for patient with COVID-19 require hospitalization in Alborz , Iran . Three psychiatric nurse perform initial screening of patient base on inclusion criterion to select patient to enter the project . these patient be select from inpatient in isolated treatment ward . all psychiatric nurse have complete personal protective equipment during screening . all information collect be transmit electronically . patient be consult and , if desire , enter the study after obtain informed consent . participant be tell that in addition to receive the require medical service , if they need psychological or psychiatric service during the project , they would be provide free of charge if they wish . participant in the project be adult who , base on medical record , be diagnose with COVID-19 and be clinically stable and willing to participate in the research project . be over the age of @card@ be one of the criterion for enter the study . if the patient do not want to continue the cooperation at any stage of the project , he/she would be exclude from the study . patient ‘ demographic information be collect as much as possible through patient ' medical record and be check with the patient . these include gender , age , marital status , employment status , and education . patient be assess through two questionnaire , the Depression , Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 ( Dass − @card@ ) and Perceived Stress Scale-4 ( PSS-4 ) . the project site be one of the large educational hospital center in Alborz province , Iran , where patient go for screening and treatment of COVID-19 disease or be refer to this center through primary care center . patient admit to the isolated ward with COVID-19 diagnosis be evaluate . in this study , accord to the inclusion criterion , @card@ patient be evaluate and finally @card@ patient be include in the study . DASS-21 be a suitable tool for measure depression , anxiety and stress , for research and clinical purpose and for such a purpose , be a validate tool among various ethnicity and population group [ @card@ ] . this tool have be evaluate in Iran in term of reliability and validity and its Persian version have satisfactory psychometric property and can be use by the Iranian population [ @card@ ] . they report the Cronbach’s alpha as @card@ for the total scale of the questionnaire , and @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ for depression , anxiety , and stress scale , respectively . this tool have 3 scale , each contain 7 question . the final score be also obtain through the sum of the score . each question vary from zero ( “ it doesn’t apply to me at all ” ) to 3 ( “ it apply to me completely ” ) . since this questionnaire be a shorten form of the main scale ( @card@ question ) , the final score of each subscale must be double . each of the subscales be divide into 4 category base on the score obtain : normal , moderate , severe and very severe [ @card@ ] . PSS be one of the most widely use tool for measure psychological stress in clinical and non-clinical situation . its internal consistency and validity have be show in various study [ @card@ ] . in Iran , Persian version of its various version ( include pss-4 ) have be evaluate and have satisfactory psychometric property . in a study in Iran , the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for it be @card@ [ @card@ ] . version 4 ( PSS-4 ) have 2 positive and 2negative phrase and its score range be from 0 to @card@ , and it have a triple classification base on intensity as high , moderate , and low [ @card@ ] . the obtain information be enter into the SPSS version @card@ . continuous and categorical variable be express as mean ( standard deviation ( SD ) ) and frequency ( percentage ) respectively . Chi-square be use to investigate the association between qualitative variable with mental health status . Pearson correlation test be use to assess correlation between scale of DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire . a P-value less than @card@ be consider as statistically significant . the Ethics Committee of Alborz University of Medical Sciences , Iran , have approve this research . ( IR . ABZUMS . REC.1399.011 , date : @card@ ) . in the case of each of the patient under study , who need further evaluation in term of psychiatric issue , the possibility of relevant psychiatric evaluation be provide to the patient so that , if desire , appropriate treatment could be perform . these facility be provide free of charge and only if the patient so wish . give that the research datum be base on human participant , the study be conduct accord to Helsinki rule . participant be inform of the objective of the study and its nature . they be assure that the information obtain from them would remain confidential . the total number of participant in the study be @card@ patient and all of the questionnaire be fill completely ( response rate @card@ % ) . the mean age of the patient be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) year . @card@ % be man and @card@ % be woman . @card@ % of the participant be marry and the rest be single . in term of job status , @card@ % be house-worker and 24.5%were unemployed . @card@ % be employee and @card@ % be retire . @card@ % be illiterate and equally have a diploma and the rest have a university degree . ( table 1 ) none of the patient have a history of alcohol consumption and 2.8%were smoker . @card@ % of patient have a history of substance use . among the patient study , @card@ patient ) 36.8%( have a history of psychiatric disorder , and 5 of them ( @card@ % ) have a history of take psychiatric medication . anxiety , depression and somatization be the most common disorder . the prevalence of underlie disease in hospitalize patient with COVID-19 in our study be as follow : hypertension ( @card@ % ) , diabetes mellitus ( @card@ % ) , hyperlipidemia ( @card@ % ) , ischemic heart disease ( @card@ % ) , asthma ( @card@ % ) , renal disease ( @card@ % ) , cerebrovascular accident ( @card@ % ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @card@ % ) , cancer ( @card@ % ) and rheumatological disease ( @card@ % ) . also , @card@ % of patient be take corticosteroid . average subclass score base on the overall score of the DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire on depression be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , anxiety be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , stress be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , and the perceive stress be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . overall , @card@ % of patient with COVID-19 have some degree of depression . severity of depression , accord to the Dass questionnaire , be @card@ % . all patient ( @card@ % ) have severe ( @card@ % ) and very severe ( @card@ % ) anxiety . regard to stress level , @card@ % of patient have some degree of stress . in the severity of stress category , @card@ % of patient have severe and very severe stress . in term of perceive stress , @card@ % of patient have high level and @card@ % have moderate level ( Fig . 2 ) . there be no statistically significant association between gender and age with depression , anxiety , stress and perception of stress . there be a statistically significant relationship between job status and the severity of depression among patient admit with COVID-19 ) P-value : 0.006( . the high prevalence of patient with severe and very severe depression be in the group of patient with freelancer . there be also a significant statistical association between education level and severity of depression ( P-value : @card@ ) . the high prevalence of patient with severe and very severe depression be observe in the group of patient with diploma and illiteracy education . be marry in patient be associate with increase anxiety ) P-value : @card@ ) . have rheumatological disease be statistically associate with stress ( P-value < @card@ ) . correlation between Scales of DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire of hospitalize patient with COVID-19 be present in Table 2 . a positive strong correlation be find between depression and perceive stress ( Coefficient : @card@ , P-value : @card@ ) . a similar correlation be find between anxiety and perceive stress ( Coefficient : @card@ , P-value : @card@ ) . the average age of patient in our study be @card@ ) Std . deviation = @card@ ) year . in some other study , most hospitalize patient with COVID-19 be in the age range of 31–70 year ( @card@ % ) [ @card@ ] . regard the relationship between socioeconomic status and psychiatric disorder , in our study , the high rate of depression be in the group of patient with diploma degree and illiterate and then in the group of people with bachelor’s degree . in various study , there be a difference of opinion between the relationship between socio-economic level and education with depression , but most study point to the inverse relationship between them [ @card@ ] . also , in our study , people with a long history of freelancer and house worker be more likely to be depress than retire people and government employee . the existence of economic problem and attention to economic prospect after the COVID-19 pandemic have raise concern in the general public about meet the essential need and economic stability . this can be accompany by mental health disorder , include depression , especially in people with occupation more likely to be affect by these economic condition [ @card@ , @card@ ] . manage existing resource , pay attention to positive international experience and use the potential of social capital can be effective step in this regard [ @card@ , @card@ ] . regard the relationship between marital status and perceive stress , some study have suggest a protective role for marriage in this area as well as in anxiety [ @card@ ] . due to the uncertainty of the condition of the COVID-19 [ 8 ] . the study of the effectiveness of common protective factor in this field require further research . the role of environmental and social factor in this regard seem important . give the complexity of the condition associate with COVID-19 , an accurate interpretation of the relationship between marriage and anxiety and stress among these patient require further evaluation in other related study . One of the point of our study be the high number of patient with underlie disease among the COVID-19 patient . these underlie disease and their prevalence in our study be hypertension ( @card@ % ) , diabetes mellitus ( @card@ % ) , hyperlipidemia ( @card@ % ) , ischemic heart disease ( @card@ % ) , asthma ( @card@ % ) and more , respectively . in a systematic review and meta-analysis , the prevalence of these underlie disease or condition in people infect with SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalize patient , respectively , have be as follow : hypertension ( @card@ % ) , cardiovascular disease ( @card@ % ) , smoking history ( @card@ % ) and diabetes ( @card@ % ) [ @card@ ] . there be a similarity between our study and other study in term of the type of underlie disease associate with the COVID-19 . however , due to difference in the number of population study , it be not possible to compare the prevalence . in general , have physical illness that weaken the immune system and physical strength be a factor that exacerbate COVID-19 disease [ @card@ ] . give the purpose of this study , which assess patient with COVID-19 in term of depression , anxiety and stress , it be important to pay attention to this issue . correlation of physical and mental illness be an important challenge in modern medicine and be associate with a great deal of interaction [ @card@ ] . in our study , there be no significant relationship between underlie disease and psychiatric disorder in patient . summarize this result require large study , preferably multicenter sample with large sample size . Lim et al . describe the first COVID-19 tertiary transmission case in South Korea . they describe a 54-year-old man with no history of physical or mental illness , smoking or drug . during his hospitalization and isolation , he develop depression , insomnia , and suicidal ideation while his treatment eventually progress satisfactorily . also , the patient experienced stress in the context of people’s reaction to patient with COVID-19 , which he receive through medium report . the patient be subsequently consult by a psychiatrist and receive medication for the problem . the author cite disease-related isolation as one of the major cause of psychological symptom in patient [ @card@ ] . accord to various source , quarantine condition for various reason have negative psychological effect . these reason include long-term quarantine , insufficient information , frustration , and stigmatization . some expert also talk about its long-term negative effect . they have advise that the course of quarantine be as short as possible and that appropriate information be provide to patient [ @card@ ] . on the other hand , one of the point that have be consider in recent year be the relationship between infection cause by respiratory virus and subsequent mood disorder . as an example , in one study , the relationship between seropositivity for influenza and coronavirus with history of mood disorder be report [ @card@ ] . this focus on the biological aspect of the relationship between coronavirus disease and mood disorder . definite conclusion in this regard also need to pay attention to various factor affect this field and conduct more extensive study . example of this group of possible connection can be see in some scientific point of view [ @card@ , @card@ ] . other study have highlight high level of anxiety as a form of psychological stress , especially follow isolation to treat COVID-19 disease [ @card@ ] . in our study , all patient who be hospitalize and isolate have some degree of anxiety , and the severity of all case be severe and very severe . anxiety symptom may be mild at first , but there be a risk that they will suddenly worsen over the course of a few day [ 33]Due to the severity of anxiety symptom in hospitalize and isolate patient , and especially due to the anticipation of anxiety disorder among hospitalize patient , it seem that the use of psychological and psychiatric counseling method , in person or through online hospital system , can be an effective way to control patient ' clinical condition . the use of other anxiety reduction technique , such as progressive muscle relaxation , have be suggest by some researcher [ @card@ ] . more than one-third of the patient study have a history of psychiatric disorder . it be important to pay attention to various aspect of the psychiatric condition of patient with a history of mental health disorder [ @card@ ] . at the time of hospitalization and after clinically stability , all patient reveal anxiety and other psychiatric manifestation . accord to a review study , the overall prevalence of psychiatric disorder in the general population in Iran be @card@ % [ @card@ ] . in another study , the prevalence of mental health disorder be @card@ % . the prevalence of anxiety and somatization syndrome be high than other disorder [ @card@ ] . in a study conduct to assess the prevalence of @card@ disease and injury in Iran and neighboring country between @card@ and @card@ , one of the most significant change be increase the effect of mental disorder , in year live with disability(YLD ) . meanwhile , major depressive disorder have be one of the main cause of Yld among the Iranian population [ @card@ ] . also in a study in Iran , the prevalence of depression among patient with diabetes be estimate at @card@ % [ @card@ ] . in another study examine the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patient with maxillofacial trauma as an acute event , the prevalence of some degree of depression and anxiety be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively [ @card@ ] . they report a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in this group than in the control group . accord to the study conduct in recent year in Iran , the prevalence of mental health disorder in Iran be increase . on the other hand , accord to various study , during the hospitalization of patient , due to acute or chronic disease , there be an increase in the prevalence of depression with anxiety among patient . these result be consistent with the result of our study , in which degree of depression and anxiety be see in @card@ % and @card@ % of hospitalize patient , respectively . Rossely et al . examine a group of hospitalize patient , note the high level of anxiety and depression among these patient compare to other individual , and emphasize the need for screening for psychiatric distress during hospitalization in different hospital ward [ @card@ ] . What we see in patient in our study be that patient with COVID-19 have a high severity of depression , anxiety , and stress , along with high level of perceive stress and it be very important to pay attention to their mental health status in addition to their medical status . Ishak et al . investigate a group of hospitalize patient and report that the prevalence of depression among these patient be between 5 and @card@ percent and an average of @card@ percent . they suggest that hospitalize patient be screen for depression . depression among hospitalize patient have be associate with poor functional outcome , bad physical health , and re-hospitalization [ @card@ ] . as note , in our study , @card@ % of patient have some degree of depression during hospitalization . in addition , Dass severity of depression scale , have severe and very severe result , in @card@ % of them , indicate a high prevalence of depression and its severity in patient . give the serious health concern of patient with COVID-19 , screening and the effective treatment of depression in these patient , along with proper follow-up after discharge , may play an effective role in improve their physical health . in a study conduct by Zatzick et al . , the status of post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , and their relationship to the patient’s subsequent occupational performance be assess @card@ month after the trauma event , and each of these be associate with a marked functional decline . they emphasize the need for early acute intervention in order to provide possible access to appropriate occupational performance in patient [ @card@ ] . give the economic problem associate with the COVID-19 pandemic , it seem that the therapeutic aspect of these patient in term of mental health disorder may have a positive effect on improve their job performance . Lee et al . examine the stress and psychological stress level of @card@ and @card@ patient in two hospital during the outbreak of SARS and one year thereafter . they have high stress level at the time of outbreak compare to the control group . the important point in their study be that one year after this study , in both group , the score of this test show that the level of stress in these patient remain high . in addition , a year after the outbreak , they still show worry level of depression , anxiety , and post-traumatic stress [ @card@ ] . give the similarity between the causative agent and the outbreak condition of SARS and COVID-19 ( although accord to many expert , COVID-19 be more worrying in term of severity and extent than SARS[49 ] ) , concern about the persistence of these demonstration be also present among these patient . in a study conduct @card@ month after the outbreak of SARS on treat SARS survivor , the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorder be @card@ % , and the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder at the time of the study be @card@ % . PTSD and subsequent depressive disorder be the most common disorder . accordingly , they describe SARS ' outbreak as a mental health catastrophe and stress the need for plan to identify and treat psychiatric disorder during other infectious epidemic [ @card@ ] . give all the available evidence and the result of our study , it be important to pay serious attention to the mental health disorder of patient with COVID-19 in order to well control possible psychiatric disorder in future . also , a review article on SARS outbreak report clear clinical symptom among patient , between @card@ % and @card@ % for depression , and 23–48 % for nonspecific anxiety . they report a high prevalence of psychiatric disorder among patient , and emphasize the need to prevent and follow up on similar condition [ @card@ ] . in another study , Chua et al . use the Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) questionnaire to examine the mental health status of hospitalize patient with SARS diagnosis . they report a significantly high level of stress among patient compare to the control group . they identify a clear link between stress and negative psychological effect [ @card@ ] . in our study , there be , in a similar situation , a significant positive statistical relationship between depression and perceive stress , as well as a positive statistical relationship between anxiety and perceive stress . there be also a positive statistical relationship between anxiety and stress . and among the group of patient with very severe depression , the high number of patient with high perceive stress be present . Depression , anxiety , stress and perceive stress be highly prevalent among patient with COVID-19 under study . there be also a high correlation between depression and anxiety with perceive stress . the high prevalence and severity of these psychiatric disorder among patient with COVID-19 emphasize the need to pay more attention to their mental health status . it seem that health policymaker need to have coherent plan for screen case and manage related situation . due to the high distribution of the disease , in order to achieve more complete result , it be recommend to conduct large study with a large sample size and in a multicenter manner .   a Unified Hierarchical XGBoost Model for Classifying Priorities for COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign General Practitioners ( GP ) will inevitably be involve in the mass vaccination against coronavirus @card@ ( COVID-19 ) . this be a substantially inevitable step , consider the widespread distribution of GP in the territory , the knowledge of the clinical and care history of individual patient , the identification of frailty patient and , above all , the situation that should be more quickly protect by vaccination coverage . unlike the flu vaccine , this vaccination campaign have be carry out with less rapidity for many reason : for great complexity in the procedure of create the vaccine , for the contingent availability of vaccine dose , for the worldwide scope/global reach of this care strategy , for the necessity of carry out the consequent administration of dose . this run the risk of create inequality both in term of health protection and in term of social benefit among individual who receive a vaccination at different time and with different priority . in the light of these consideration , it seem appropriate , therefore , to hypothesize solution that offer great objectivity in assign priority to vaccine administration . support in this direction can be expect from artificial intelligence ( Ai ) and machine learning ( ML ) solution that , apply to the clinical-assistance Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) datum of GP , could provide indication that , although not definitive , would help the doctor to establish priority to vaccine administration [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . start from a unified GP datum share protocol , the aim of this paper be to design and develop a ML algorithm , namely Hierarchical Priority Classification extreme Gradient Boosting ( HPC-XGB ) , for classify priority for COVID-19 vaccine administration use the EHR datum collect by GP . the ML model learn prioritizing subject accord to the priority selection criterion define by the interim recommendation on the target group of the anti-SARS CoV-2/Covid19 vaccination issue by the Italian Ministry of Health ( @card@ ) , which have be submit to the attention of the State-Regions Conference and that identify the prioritized category for the vaccination1 . this work contribute to the pattern recognition and clinical field for the follow reason : ( i ) it introduce a novel data-driven methodology for severity assessment and stratification of COVID-19 disease . the propose ML approach seek to provide indication that , although not definitive , would help the GP to establish the priority for vaccine administration ; ( ii ) it measure the effectiveness of the propose methodology for classify all the priority class across new unseen patient from different GP and demonstrate a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art . in particular , the propose method learn simultaneously discriminative pattern by take into account all of these priority criterion ( i. e. Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity ) , thus avoid specific bias on a single criterion ; ( iii ) it evaluate the reliability of the propose approach in the novel Italian Federation of GP EHR dataset ( namely , FIMMG_COVID ) compose of @card@ patient collect from @card@ different GP ' ( Core Data Team ) . the clinical significance of the propose approach be confirm by the integration as a clinical decision support system ( CDSS ) of the NetMedica Italia ( NMI ) platform for all NMI GP . the CDSS be currently support the GP for assign COVID-19 vaccine administration priority to their assistants2 . moreover , an in-depth analysis provide evidence on how the propose method can be exploit to localize the most discriminative predictor for predict priority class . such insight could further support the finer-grained priority classification for vaccine administration . the paper be organize as follow : in Section 2 , we provide a review of vaccine administration and Machine Learning base CDSS for clinical diagnosis . we describe the FIMMG_COVID EHR dataset 3 which we use for our investigation and the formulation and evaluation for our methodology describe in Section 4 . the result of our method be report in Section 5 , and we provide the clinical impact and conclusion in section 6 and 7 . clinical literature offer several work with the aim of provide an affordable immunization program against different disease by monitor the vaccine administration [ 3 ] . in addition to that , research have be conduct even on vaccine prioritization , allocation and ration [ 4 ] with a specific age-dependent mathematical model at the base . these work include also a Social Media sentiment analysis in order to seize public opinion on different vaccine and promote the campaign vaccination at a very large scale [ 5 ] . however , none of these work focus directly on the prediction of class priority use ML model and datum collect from GP . recently , the potential of ML application on the healthcare scenario give a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak [ 6 ] . the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic be a reminder of the importance of vaccination . indeed , it be a current and crucial priority to develop an effective and timely vaccine administration campaign towards this highly contagious disease [ 7 ] . for that reason , differently , from the current application of ML and Ai for COVID-19 [ 6 ] , we aim to answer this still unresolved and topical challenge , i. e. the prediction of priority of COVID-19 vaccine administration . beyond clinical diagnosis , disease modeling and risk stratification , the employment of machine learn for design CDSS be of practical interest . in this context , research be currently focus on bridge the gap between development and implementation of clinical Ai , by ensure a still central position to human being [ 8 ] . the generation of staggering volume of EHR datum along with the increase in computational power , storage and memory allow ML methodology to create a great opportunity to perform a wide range of complex task with impressive accuracy in healthcare and epidemiological contexts[9 ] . health informatic technology be crucial for predictive medicine provide clinician tool that be able to give information about individual at risk , disease onset and how to intervene . Data-driven technique be use to analyze this multifactorial temporal datum store in EHR to discover complex pattern and set up advanced ML model , which can manage this enormous amount of datum by predict clinical outcome and interpret particular pattern sometimes unsighted by physician . moreover , these predictive ML model can help physician to predict early-stage disease by also detect the most relevant clinical factor associate with a risk condition profile . ML technique have be widely use for extract information from such a large amount of datum and have prove useful in improve diagnosis , outcome prediction , and management of chronic disease . this include a possibility for the identification of high risk for medical emergency such as transition into another disease state , for example , the progression from pre-diabetes to T2D use routinely collect EHR datum . the state of the art ML model employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification include Decision Tree [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , RF [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , XGB [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , Linear Support Vector Machine ( Li-SVM ) , Gaussian Support Vector Machine ( G-SVM ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and Lasso Support Vector Machine ( La-SVM ) [ 1 ] . real-world datasets extract from EHRs usually own high dimensionality datum and several noisy and/or redundant feature . manage and model this amount of information may lead to several challenge such as i ) overfitting ; ii ) reduction of interpretability ; iii ) data heterogeneity and iv ) missing value . Recent research in this direction overcome the interpretability and data heterogeneity issue by propose a feature selection and encode approach which correspond respectively to correntropy regularize joint learning and deep polynomial network [ @card@ ] . still in[15 ] , the author propose a predictive model base on a support set make by vector regression model for predict the status of Alzheimer’s disease . similarly , the author in [ @card@ ] , leveraged a multiple kernel learn ( MKL ) to predict Alzheimer’s disease by model feature of different nature and select kernel with more discriminative power . with the aim to improve the generalization performance by learn a shared structure , multi-task learning ( MTL ) base approach be propose in [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] to model spatial correlation exist in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and cognitive measure . accordingly , in [ 2 ] MTL be introduce to model a spatio-temporal relationship among laboratory exam and in presence of miss annotation [ @card@ ] in order to predict complication relate to type 2 diabetes and the evolution of kidney disease . differently from all the above-cited work , our task aim to predict priority for COVID-19 vaccine administration for patient care by GP . because of these difference in the task definition with respect to other state of the art work , our task include some additional methodological challenge mainly relate to : ( i ) avoid possible bias in the prediction rule . notice how the solution of this task mainly depend on multiple clinical criterion such as Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity and ( ii ) handle categorical and ordinal datum with highly imbalanced class . this fact include the possibility to have a great focus ( great bias ) on the large priority class than the minority class . this paper have the ambition to overcome these challenge by propose a Hierarchical Priority Classification-XGBoost . differently from feature selection [ @card@ ] and MKL strategy [ @card@ ] , our approach demonstrate a natural ability to handle heterogeneous datum . moreover , in contrast to MTL approach [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , our procedure allow to simultaneously predict multiple priority class while avoid unwanted bias in the prediction rule . furthermore , alternatively to linearized sparse model , the approach propose in [ @card@ ] perform non-linear feature selection by associate a base kernel for each feature ( non-linear multiple-kernel strategy ) , thus decrease the overall interpretability . it be worth note here that , baseline ordinal regression model may not overcome these challenge , thus provide a bias in the prediction rule and on the large priority class . take into account these difference in the task definition , with the main objective to demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose solution , we decide to compare the propose ML model with respect to other regression algorithm employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification . in particular , in Section @card@ we have provide evidence of the superiority of our propose approach . some distance-based methodology widely use for pattern recognition task , could be potentially tailor to provide indication and establish priority for vaccine administration . these method may include the complex evidential distance [ @card@ ] , the complex evidential quantum dynamical model [ @card@ ] and a complex mass function [ @card@ ] that be propose to measure the difference or dissimilarity among piece of evidence . in particular , the totality of these approach be embed in the decision-making algorithm for the purpose of solve a pattern recognition task in a medical diagnosis scenario . despite the fact that all these methodology produce a promising way of model and handle uncertain information that can be integrate as loss function in a distance metric learning[23 ] , the so-called curse of dimensionality problem can emerge . in our task indeed , the nature of the problem arise with a high dimensionality and a heterogeneous set of predictor . for this reason , our methodology be specifically conceive to manage data heterogeneity issue by reduce overfitting . nowadays , information system that can support the territorial clinical network and potentially manage the entire clinical history of an individual where the information be share be need . the Italian Federation of General Practitioners ( FIMMG ) , through NMI ( a FIMMG Company ) , have design an initiative of it share among physician , with an interface available to interoperate with the rest of the healthcare ecosystem . the most suitable solution be the adoption of a Saas ( Software as a Service ) Cloud-based information system . the Saas Cloud aim to provide user an application accessible anywhere an Internet connection be available . the software and datum reside on cluster of server that deliver the service without the need to store datum locally . the management of this initiative have be entrust to NMI , with the aim of share the datum in a safe way , provide a series of service and utility available to the general practitioner who want to join . NMI’s intervention be focus on the replication in a cloud of physician ' EHR datum , accord to a standardized language . physician can access the database remotely , both with a PC and with mobile device . the NMI Cloud platform provide functionality for the individual physician but also for territorial aggregation . the most significant health event of non-hospitalized patient be store in standardized EHR table . thus , EHR datum allow trace the particular condition of patient such as rare and chronic disease , disability and medical prescription . the heterogeneity of the collected EHR field permit an analysis of the evolution of the disease progression , patient treatment and patient care . timely observation of health status datum in primary care , even in association with prolonged lifestyle and socio-economic information , be promise for predictive purpose and risk factor identification . territorial care ensure continuity of care both in the management of patient discharge from hospital after the post-COVID-19 acute phase and in the treatment of less severe post-COVID-19 follow-up at home . the criterion that have to be satisfy be the following : usability of datum , security in the transmission and storage of datum , inaccessibility of the cloud manager , accessibility to the component of the territorial care only through the release of individual credential , compliance for the patient ' right to control their personal datum in the cloud and the possible partial or total obscuration . in addition , it be necessary that the provider of cloud computing service guarantee compliance with the organizational and functional method define by current European regulatory requirement , also in term of integration between company ' information system and general practice information system . citizen be inform by their physician , on the purpose for which their sensitive datum be collect . currently , the FIMMG NMI system manage more than @card@ thousand GP with approximately @card@ million patient in total [ @card@ ] . FIMMG EHR database mainly consist of ( i ) patient-oriented datum , which include personal datum , a series of fix medical datum ( e. g. blood group , normal value for weight and pressure , etc. ) , medical history , exemption , intolerances and allergy . and ( ii ) GP-oriented datum , which include datum produce by the GP’s activity , such as outpatient visit , prescription for therapy or specialist visit , illness or various certificate , vaccination , extra service perform by the GP and patient monitoring . the standardized FIMMG EHR table be summarize below : Anagraphic : the table include the patient’s personal information , identification datum and basic health information , Monitoring : the table store demographic , anthropometric and pressure monitoring datum , Examination prescription : the table include a prescription diary provide for the storage of all clinical prescription relate to laboratory , instrumental , specialist , rehabilitation and hospital visit , Drug prescription : the table store datum relate to drug prescription , e-Prescriptions : the table store datum relate to electronic prescription , Pathologies : the table contain the patient’s pathology , exemption : the table store datum relate to patient exemption in term of exemption code , Laboratory : the table include the result of any clinical exam prescribe by the GP , Illness/accident certificate : the table include the medical certificate issue for any patient , Family history : the table contain family history datum for each patient , Assistance period : the table identify the period of assistance that bind the GP to their patient , Intolerance-Allergies : the table store datum relate to a patient’s allergy or intolerances , Clinical Diary : the table contain the GP’s clinical diary , Lifestyle : the table store information on the patient’s lifestyle , with a particular focus on alcohol and smoking habit , Admission : the table store admission information relate to the diagnosis and identification of the facility be store , Schedule : the table contain some plan activity for each patient , Vaccination : the table contain information relate to vaccine administration . the FIMMG_COVID dataset originate from a subset of the FIMMG EHR database in use at FIMMG Netmedica cloud architecture . the FIMMG_COVID dataset consist of @card@ patient collect from @card@ different GP ' EHR datum ( see Table 1 ) . the mean and standard deviation of the age of each GP’s patient group be also report . the @card@ GP ( Core Data Team ) be select from those enroll in the NMI cloud platform and they actively participate in define the priority criterion . the Core Data Team be locate in the North ( 4 GP ) , the Center ( 4 GP ) and the South ( 3 GP ) of Italy and they assist all the patient consider in the study . additionally , among the hundred of GP enroll in the NMI platform , these @card@ select be intensively involve in improve all the NMI cloud platform service . the ethical committee of University approve the experimental study and its guideline as a clinical noninterventional ( observational ) study . FIMMG_COVID dataset be anonymous and their use , detention and conservation be regulate by an agreement between the FIMMG , NMI and University . All the process be inside the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) . standard medical care ( prophylactic , diagnostic and therapeutic ) will remain under the responsibility of the individual’s GP team . All the perform analysis and the propose ML methodology be in compliance with the Ai guideline relate to Ai management plan toward a trustworthy Ai , promote human agency and oversight , robustness and safety , privacy and data governance , transparency , diversity , non-discrimination and fairness , societal and environmental well-being and accountability [ @card@ ] . the Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies table be include in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . the Anagraphic , Monitoring , and Pathologies table be select accord to @card@ the GP’s indication as to the most potential discriminative field for classify the severity of chronic disease and thus the PC class . these table result in the candidate feature display in Table 2 . the patient and GP id be the key column that be common for all table . the GP id model the annotation variability and data collection among different GP . the id DB take into account the different NMI interface the GP can handle during annotation and datum collection procedure . the employ EHR reflect the clinical use-case scenario , where not all monitoring feature be annotate uniformly across patient . as a consequence , a very sparse observation per patient correspond to each different type of monitor feature . the pathology be classify accord to the International Classification of Disease ( ICD-9 ) . the target variable be represent by the priority class define by the Core Data Team to their outpatient EHR datum ( FIMMG_COVID dataset ) accord to a unified priority selection criterion . these priority selection criterion take into account the interim recommendation on the target group of the anti-SARS CoV-2/Covid19 vaccination issue by the Ministry of Health ( document of @card@ ) , submit to the attention of the State-Regions Conference , which identify the category that should be prioritized for vaccination3 . due to the large population include in the category identify by the document , a further stratification be necessary in order to proceed with extreme rationality to the progression of vaccine administration . thus the priority class annotation be perform by GP follow these clinical criterion : age : one of the parameter that most influence the risk of the disease ; Dysautonomia : it require the presence of assistant for daily life activity ( e. g. bedding ) , thus lead to the high exposure of infection ; Chronic pathology : the concomitance of chronic pathology ( cardiovascular , respiratory , neoplastic , metabolic , neurological disease ) represent an element that significantly affect the prognosis ; obesity : it be identify from the epidemiological datum and the recent clinical literature as one of the risk factor for great COVID-19 severity and mortality [ @card@ ] . the definition of these clinical criterion be in line with the recent clinical finding [ @card@ ] that demonstrate how the age-related comorbidities have a more important weight than the age itself . All the consider criterion ( Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic Pathologies and Obesity ) be high-level clinical criterion that be not encode as annotation in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . for that reason , a ML-based approach could be suitable in order to capture discriminative and high-level pattern within the EHR feature that be hardly discoverable use ruled-based approach . all of these criterion should be take into account for design a ML model for predict priority class . in particular , the ML model should be address to focus simultaneously on find a discriminative pattern on all of these criterion without reflect a more focus on a single criterion , thus avoid specific bias on Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity . follow these criterion , table 3 report the priority class identify by GP and the number of patient attribute to each priority class by the Core Data Team in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . notice how the priority class @card@ be not affect by clinical criterion and thus not consider in the perform analysis . chronic pathology include cardiovascular , respiratory , neoplastic , metabolic , neurological disorder of different entity : small , medium and severe entity . the severe entity reflect an unstable clinical condition often follow a recent episode of illness or aggravation of the underlie disease , with the compromise general condition and/or obvious organ failure . the medium entity reflect stable clinical condition with a history of recent instability , risk factor with high unpredictability of evolution . the low entity reflect stable clinical condition , the presence of morbid condition characterize risk factor and chronic disease at the low stage . follow state of the art work for predictive medicine [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] the average of each Monitoring feature ( Weight , Height , Waist circumference , Systolic Blood pressure and Diastolic Blood pressure ) be compute for each patient . a missing value occurrence ( Nan ) highlight that the monitoring exam be not available for the patient and thus be replace with zero value ( 0-value imputation ) . although the baseline XGB have a natural ability to handle missing value , by learn the good direction to handle miss value [ @card@ ] , the 0-value imputation allow to well characterize the meaning of the missing occurrence , i. e. that the monitoring exam be not available for the patient and thus be replace with 0-value . moreover , all the patient who do not have the Age feature be exclude . this fact lead to consider @card@ out of @card@ patient . the one-hot hierarchical encode procedure be use on categorical feature ( i. e. , ICD9 code of Pathologies feature ) . hence , the 1 and 0 display the presence or absence of a specific ICD9 pathology for each subject respectively . since the level of detail among code category vary greatly [ @card@ ] , the @card@ most frequent ICD9-macro category ( i. e. the first 3 digit of ICD9 code ) be encode ( see Table 4 ) . the propose HPC-XGB consist of two hierarchical layer of different XGBoost model . the XGBoost method be apply as a prediction model for each layer in consideration of its characteristic of high generalization performance , and the low risk of overfitting and high interpretability that outperform other datum mine method widely use for solve predictive medicine task use tabular datum , i. e. EHR datum [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] . the gradient tree boost algorithm extend the concept of adaptive boost by sequentially add predictor and correct previous model use the gradient descent algorithm [ @card@ ] . although traditional method employ univariate and multivariate statistical analysis to answer pattern discrimination question , the application of a machine learn approach base on the XGB model improve the sensitivity of detection and generalization performance by combine multiple information across several variable ( i. e. , high dimensional problem and data heterogeneity ) with relative low sample datum . moreover , the exact aim of our work be to create a model that could be integrate into a Clinical Decision Support System ( CDSS ) with no need to apply human intervention during the preprocessing stage . indeed , since XGB make no assumption on data distribution and use individual decision tree , it be potentially unaffected by multi-collinearity . for the FIMMG_COVID dataset N examples/patients with m=29 feature be consider for the training stage . the Yi∈PC be the label of the ith patient sample Xi∈Rm . the tree ensemble model use K additive function to predict the output as follow : ( 1)y^i=ϕ(Xi)=∑k=1Kfk(Xi ) , fk∈F where F be the space of regression tree . therefore the following regularize empirical loss function be minimize : ( 2)L(ϕ)=∑iL(y^i , yi)+∑kΩ(fk)where(3)Ω(f)=T+12λ∥w∥2 T be the depth of the tree , L be a differentiable convex loss function that measure the difference between the prediction y^i and the target yi , Ω(f ) be the regularization term which control the complexity of the model via the T and λ hyperparameters . the hyperparameters T and λ be optimize in the validation set in term of maximum depth of a tree and l2 penalty ( see Table 5 ) . the loss function be minimize in an iterative manner as follow : ( 4)L(t)=∑i=1NL(yi , y^i(t−1)+ft(Xi))+Ω(ft)where y^i(t ) be the prediction of the i-th instance at the t-th iteration . the standard exact greedily algorithm enumerate over all the possible split on all the feature and select the good split for minimize the Equation 4 . since it be computationally demand to enumerate all the possible split for candidate feature the XGBoost extension introduce a theoretically justify weighted quantile sketch for approximate learning . moreover , a sparsity-aware algorithm for handle sparse datum ( miss value ) be adopt [ @card@ ] . the propose HPC-XGB be describe in Figure 2 and all the calculation step be describe in Algorithm 1 . the Age be one of the parameter that most influence the risk of the disease and thus the classification of priority class . however , the aim be to enforce the ML algorithm to focus not only on a single criterion ( e. g. thus avoid specific bias on Age ) , but instead to learn discriminative pattern on specific patient condition also relate to Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity . for that reason , our ordinal problem be split into two classification layer ( Layer A and Layer B ) . in the first layer , task A be define as the classification between the high vulnerable patient and the other category . notice how this task do not only depend on age but on all consider clinical criterion : ( 5 ) where YiA=0 ∀ PCi={1⋯7,9⋯22,24⋯26 } , YiA=1 ∀ PCi={8 } . the weighted logistic loss function be use as the objective function of the XGB A : ( 6)L(y^iA , yiA)=1N∑i=1NN1AyiAln(1+e−y^iA)+N0A(1−yiA)ln(1+ey^iA ) where N1A and N0A be the number of training patient belong to YiA=1 and YiA=0 respectively . follow the rationale describe by Eq . 4 , the second layer B be design by cluster each sub-task B relate to the YiA=0 where the target class be independent with the Age feature for at least one subset of patient collect by one GP : ( 7)where s=1⋯7 be the total number of sub-tasks B , GPid∈{1 , ⋯,11 } be the GP id , YGPid , Bs⊂PC be the associated label for the sub-task B and GP id and XageGPid , Bs⊂XageBs be the predictor for the sub-task B and GP id . the independence of binary subtasks |YBs|=2 be measure accord to a Mann-Whitney U test , a nonparametric statistical significance test for determine whether two independent sample be draw from a population with the same distribution . in particular , the statistical test point out that for each sub-task YBs there be at least one subpopulation from one GP where it be not possible to reject the null hypothesis ( α=0.05 ) that there be no difference in the distribution of the XageGPid , B between the two associated label ( YGPid , Bs⊂PC ) . similarly , the independence of multiclass subtasks |YBs|>2 be measure accord to a Kruskal Wallis test , a generalization of the Mann-Whitney U test for the case of multiple distribution . notice how each subtask B be focus to discriminate the PC in a specific age range . indeed , this classification be mainly dependent from the other clinical criterion ( i. e. dysautonomia , chronic pathology and obesity ) . the weighted logistic loss function be use as the objective function of the XGB B for solve binary sub-tasks : ( 8)L(y^iBs , yiBs)=1NBs∑i=1NBsN1BsyiBsln(1+e−y^iBs)+N0Bs(1−yiBs)ln(1+ey^iBs ) where NBs be the number of training patient for the subtask B , N1Bs and N0Bs be the number of patient belong to the binary class ( YBs⊂PC ) . the weighted categorical cross-entropy loss ( soft-max loss ) be use as the objective function of the XGB B model for solve multi-class sub-tasks : ( 9)L(y^iBs , yiBs)=−1NBs∑k=1CNcBsyikBsln(1+e−y^ikBs ) Notice how the additional weight introduce in the employ loss function ( see ( 6 ) , ( 8 ) , ( 9 ) ) , allow to deal with the naturalistic imbalanced setting of this task . the predictive performance of the propose HPC-XGB be evaluate for solve task a ( vulnerability ) and subtasks B ( severity of disorder ) . the predictive performance be evaluate accord to the follow measure : accuracy : the percentage of correct prediction ; macro-recall :\n",
            "the recall be calculate for each class and then take the unweighted mean . the recall reflect the percentage of true positive over the condition positive ( sensitivity ) ; confusion matrix : the square matrix that show the type of error in a supervised paradigm ; false positive rate : the false positive rate for task a ; false negative Rate ( FNR ) : the false negative rate for task a ; receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve : be design by plot the true positive rate ( TPR ) against the false positive rate ( FPR ) at various threshold setting . it illustrate the performance of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold be vary . from now on we refer to the recall , False Positive Rate and False negative rate as recall , FPR and FNR respectively . it be worth note here that , the goal of our paper be to establish the priority to COVID-19 vaccine administration and the FIMMG_COVID dataset be currently the only dataset for this . however , we decide to compare the propose HPC-XGB with respect to other ML algorithm employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification . these state of the art ML model include Decision Tree [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , RF [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , XGB with different loss function ( mean square errro , tweedie and gamma ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , Linear Support Vector Machine ( Li-SVM ) , Gaussian Support Vector Machine ( G-SVM ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and Lasso Support Vector Machine ( La-SVM ) [ 1 ] . since our goal be to solve an ordinal regression task ( classification of @card@ PC ) , as comparison , the regression formulation of these model be adopt . in the experimental comparison we have further include the feature selection and ensemble of support vector regression approach propose in [ @card@ ] along with the multi-task regression-based approach propose in [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] . similarly to [ @card@ ] , we train different La-SVM use different feature modality ( Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies ) . the final prediction be achieve by average the single model prediction . as a comparison , we also employ a similar MTL strategy employ in [ @card@ ] . different from the linearized sparse model , the approach propose in [ @card@ ] perform non-linear feature selection by associate a base kernel for each feature ( non-linear multiple-kernel strategy ) , thus decrease the interpretability . hence , we adopt as a comparison the linearized MTL strategy for feature learn ( l2,1MTL ) . notice how in the l2,1 MTL comparison the task a and task B be solve simultaneously by learn a similar sparse feature structure . the experimental comparison aim to evaluate the potential of the propose HPC-XGB for classify all @card@ PC . by perform these comparison the aim be to measure how the HPC-XGB be able to improve the state-of-the-art methodology in order to firstly discriminate the highly vulnerable class ( PC=8 ) and at the same time to provide a classification among different age-dependent PC . hence , three different testing procedure be perform and they be relate to : ( i ) testing procedure a ) : performance be evaluate with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class ) for predict PC 8 with respect to the other PC class . we measure the performance of test procedure a ) in term of overall accuracy , recall , FPR and FNR ; ( ii ) testing procedure b ) the performance be evaluate with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class except class 8 ) for predict all PC class except class 8 . we measure the performance of test procedure b ) in term of overall accuracy and recall . since the testing procedure b ) can be conceive as a standard regression task we also evaluate the performance in term of Mean Absolute Error ( Mae ) , Mean Square Error ( MSE ) and coefficient of determination ( R2 score ) ; ( iii ) testing procedure c ) the performance be evaluate with respect to the well competing state-of-the-art classification model train for each subtask . the performance of testing procedure be measure c ) in term of average accuracy and recall . for all the experimental comparison and testing procedure , the recall be the selected metric optimize in the validation set . the rationale behind the optimization of the recall in the validation set be justify by the fact to achieve an objective that be more clinically relevant for a screening purpose . thus , the author , follow this rationale , preferred to minimize the false negative and achieve a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity . this choice have be also perform accord to the most recent state-of-the-art approach in predictive medicine scenario [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . hence , to test HPC-XGB for a significant difference from chance-level classification , the one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( significance level = @card@ ) be perform compare the recall distribution with respect to the level of chance ( i. e. @card@ for the binary task and 1/C for the multi-class task ) . moreover , the non-parametric one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( significance level = @card@ ) be also use to test the overall performance of the HPC-XGB for a significant difference from the general performance of the state of the art model ( test procedure a ) and b ) ) and to perform a statistical comparison between the HPC-XGB and the good standard supervise learn competitor ( testing procedure c ) . table 5 summarize the range of the hyperparameters optimize for each ML model during the LOGPO procedure . table 6 show the predictive performance of the HPC-XGB for each task . we report the average and the standard deviation of accuracy and recall across all run of the LOGPO procedure . for the task a the HPC-XGB achieve the good performance ( accuracy = 0.854(0.060 ) , recall = 0.768(0.109 ) ) . for all the B subtasks except B1 , the performance of HPC-XGB be significantly high than the chance level . this fact can be motivate by the high imbalanced setting of task B1 : only a few patient ( @card@ , less than 4 % ) have the PC equal to @card@ . with the purpose of provide additional proof behind our feature extraction step , we perform additional experiment by ( i ) consider all ICD-9 pathology category and ( ii ) include the one-hot hierarchical encode of exemption and drug prescription with all ICD-9 pathology category . the additional experiment ( i ) and ( ii ) highlight a decrease of the averaged-recall of 4 % and 7 % respectively , for solve Task A. as a result , the @card@ feature constitute the most discriminative predictor to feed our HPC-XGB methodology figure 4 show the recall and the ROC and the Area under Curve ( AUC ) of HPC-XGB for each subset of patient assign by different GP in each run of LOGPO procedure for solve task A. Notice how the recall and the AUC remain always above chance level . the theoretical complexity of the propose model depend on the maximum depth of the tree ( T ) and the # of estimator ( EI ) . however , the block structure for parallel learning and the approximate algorithm [ @card@ ] be employ for reduce the training complexity , especially when N be high . the time complexity can be compute as O(EITN+NlogB ) where B be the maximum number of row in each block and depend on the number of the CPU core , thus achieve , a competitive gain with respect to standard gradient boost algorithm O(EITNlogN ) . the experimental computation time analysis for the training and for the testing stage be perform in Table 7 . the computation time for the training stage be compute by consider only the outer loop of the LOGPO procedure , i. e. once the hyperparameter tune procedure be complete ) ( see Figure 3 ) . the propose HPC-XGB algorithm achieve a competitive computation time for both the training ( less than @card@ sec ) and test stage ( less than @card@ sec ) for solve Task A and each B subtasks . All the experiment be reproducible , and they be perform use a @card@ GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core with 16GB of Ram . the comparison with respect to the state of the art be perform use the testing procedure a ) , b ) and c ) describe in @card@ . in the testing procedure a ) ( see Table 8 ) we evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class ) for predict PC 8 with respect to the other PC class . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) and the baseline XGB in term of recall of about @card@ % and @card@ % respectively for classify high vulnerable subject ( PC=8 ) . in the test procedure b ) ( see Table 9 ) we evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class except class 8 ) for predict all PC class except class 8 . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) and the baseline XGB in term of recall of about @card@ % and @card@ % respectively for classify all age-related class . in the test procedure c ) ( see Table @card@ ) we compare the good performing state of the art model ( DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) train for each subtask with respect to the propose HPC-XGB . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome significantly the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) in term of recall for classify subtask B2 , B3 , B4 , B6 and B7 . To provide insight into the model interpretability ( see Figure 5 ) , the most discriminative predictor for classify priority class be highlight . in particular , we compute the importance of each input feature in our HPC-XGB by consider the number of time a feature be use to split the datum across all tree . then , we average the importance across each LOGPO run . the compute feature importance value be normalize from 0 to 1 with respect to all element . notice how although the age be one of the most discriminative predictor for solve task A , B3 , B5 , B7 , other clinical factor ( i. e. the presence of a specific pathology ) represent the most discriminative predictor for solve task B2 , B4 ( icd9_464 acute laryngitis and tracheitis ) and for solve task B6 ( icd9_522 disease of pulp and periapical tissue ) . a preliminary validation make by the Core Data Team confirm how the model interpretability result of our study provide novel insight into the good combination of conventionally and non-conventionally use feature for discriminate vulnerability and disease severity . moreover , the high feature importance of GP id demonstrate the high variability of the annotation procedure that can be subjectively condition by the GP itself and the GP’s knowledge of the patient’s medical history . further clinical validation of the overall CDSS be perform on an additional dataset of @card@ patient collect by other @card@ GP . in the first analysis , the @card@ GP focus on reanalyzing only the misclassify patient by the ML algorithm , with the purpose of verify whether the predict PC be more effective compare to their previous annotation . the main objective of this analysis be to inspect how the propose CDSS , in some situation , be also able to offer a more effective PC proposal than GP by discover particular pattern that can be sometimes unsighted by physician . we find how the GP revise their annotation in @card@ % of the total of misclassify patient , by confirm the correct prediction of the ML algorithm . moreover , we evaluate the generalization power of the propose CDSS by propagate the error between layer and by evaluate the accuracy between all the predict PC and the ground-truth label for each different tolerance threshold . the predict PC be consider correct if its deviation with respect to the ground-truth label fall within a specific threshold . thus , a great threshold reflect a more tolerance to the misclassification error of the model . our model correctly predict the PC class up to an overall accuracy of @card@ % with a tolerance threshold of ±6 ( see Figure 7 ) . this outcome be also in line with the clinical and ethic guideline in order to provide a CDSS base on ML that be as align as possible with the GP ( human agency and oversight , [ @card@ ] ) . the COVID-19 outbreak pose an unprecedented challenge for policymaker and healthcare worker across the world , by highlight the need for preventive and precise solution capable to provide clinical support for the treatment and management of the COVID-19 patient . in conclusion , our work have the potential to play a fundamental role in this scenario , for the development of learn healthcare system , that may support the vaccination campaign by provide indication that although not definitive , would help the GP to establish the priority to vaccine administration . we also demonstrate the high level of generalization of the propose HPC-XGB approach across new unseen patient from different GP . One limitation of the propose approach lie in consider only static predictor ( i. e. Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies field ) in the propose ML model . interesting future work in this context may be address to consider the temporal observation of laboratory exam . although we can have a limited and sparse set of exam for each patient , a multiple-instance-based approach may encourage a temporal structure of the value of the exam for each patient while deal with the sparse nature of this task [ @card@ ] . To well integrate ordinal structure among class , and to further minimize the error between distant class , another interesting future direction would be to extend the HPC-XGB methodology for impose an ordinal constraint among priority class within the age-related subtasks . this may involve the introduction of an ordinal loss ( e. g. quadratic weight kappa loss [ @card@ ] ) in the HPC-XGB for penalize the misclassification error that be further from the correct class . the author declare that they have no compete interest .   manage pneumonia through facility-based integrated management of childhood management ( IMCI ) service : an analysis of the service availability and readiness among public health facility in Bangladesh Bangladesh be one of the few high burden country with limited resource which achieve the ambitious MDG-4 target of reduce the under-5 mortality rate by two-third ) ahead of @card@ [ 1 , 2 ] . despite this commendable accomplishment , Bangladesh still suffer one of the high under-5 mortality rate in the world [ 3 ] . accord to the late Demographic and Health Survey conduct in @card@ , the under-5 mortality in Bangladesh be @card@ per thousand live birth , indicate an apparent stall in the rate of reduction from the @card@ estimate of @card@ per thousand live birth [ 2 , 3 ] . with an estimated @card@ death per year , pneumonia account for @card@ % of all under-5 death , make it the single large cause of death among young child [ 4 ] . therefore , achieve the ambitious 2030-SDG target of reduce the under-5 mortality to @card@ per thousand live birth or below will require strategic focus , substantial investment and concerted effort by all stakeholder by prioritisation of pneumonia at every stage [ 5 , 6 ] . cognizant of the high burden of pneumonia morbidity and mortality in the majority of Low- and Middle-Income Countries ( LMICs ) , the World Health Organization ( who ) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund ( UNICEF ) set forth an ambitious goal to end all preventable death due to pneumonia by @card@ [ 5 ] . Bangladesh declare its commitment to reduce the pneumonia specific mortality rate among child less than 5 year of age from eight death per thousand live birth to three death per thousand live birth by @card@ by implement who and UNICEF’s Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea ( GAPPD ) [ 5 ] . ensure timely and appropriate management of pneumonia through outpatient and inpatient care be one of the key component of GAPPD’s ‘ prevent-protect-treat ' strategy [ 5 ] . for outpatient management of common childhood illness , include pneumonia , the global recommendation be to adopt the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) strategy in high-burden and low-resource setting [ 7 , 8 ] . IMCI have demonstrate a positive impact in improve health worker ' performance and quality of care as well as reduce childhood mortality , include pneumonia in setting with limited resource [ 9–16 ] . however , success depend on the effective implementation of the three basic pillar outline in the IMCI strategy , which include improve health worker ' skill , improve the health system to ensure supply of essential item to provide quality service , and improve family and community practice [ 17–20 ] . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be among the first step towards strengthen the health system [ @card@ , @card@ ] . they be also fundamental to ensure the provision of care , which be one of the core component of WHO’s Quality of Care Framework [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the government of Bangladesh ( GoB ) adopt the IMCI strategy in @card@ , and facility-based IMCI be scale up in all district ( @card@ ) and more than @card@ % of all sub-districts ( @card@ ) by @card@ [ @card@ , @card@ ] . accord to the current programme implementation model , IMCI service be provide through a dedicated corner ( i. e. IMCI corner ) at the outpatient department in all district and sub-district level hospital [ @card@ , @card@ ] . at the sub-district level , IMCI service be provide through union-level health centre . doctor , nurse or paramedic ( locally know as SACMOs ) with special in-service training be responsible for provide IMCI service [ @card@ , @card@ ] . unfortunately , there be little evidence regard the current status of service availability , readiness and quality of care render through IMCI service in Bangladesh . such information , particularly those that be relate to pneumonia management , be critical for understand the health system bottleneck and take course corrective measure to achieve the ambitious 2025-GAPPD and 2030-SDG target . this paper attempt to address this critical evidence gap by present the status of IMCI service , explicitly focus on the service availability and readiness relate to IMCI-based pneumonia management in Bangladesh , stratify by rural-urban , administrative division and type of health facility . we conduct a secondary analysis of the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey ( BHFS ) , which be conduct in @card@ with a nationally representative sample of health facility [ @card@ ] . the survey include all type of public hospital and health centre as well as some private and Ngo hospital with at least @card@ inpatient bed . the survey be carry out by the National Institute of Population Research and Training ( NIPORT ) with technical assistance from ICF International ( USA ) and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( icddr , b ) . datum be collect by associate for Community and Population Research ( ACPR ) , Dhaka , a private research agency appoint by NIPORT for this survey . Bangladesh be divide into eight administrative division ( Barisal , Chittagong , Dhaka , Khulna , Rajshahi , Rangpur , Sylhet , and Mymensingh ) , which be subdivide into @card@ district ( zilas ) , and further divide into @card@ sub-districts ( upazilas ) . the public health system in Bangladesh have three tier of referral hospital and two type of health centre . at the district level , there be Medical College Hospitals as tertiary level referral hospital , District Hospitals ( DHs ) as secondary level referral hospital with 250–500 bed . at the sub-district level , there be Upazila Health Complexes ( UHCs ) as primary level referral hospital with @card@ bed . below the sub-district level , there be Union Health and Family Welfare Centres ( UH&FWCs ) and Community clinic ( CCs ) and ) as health centre . in addition , there be Maternal and Child Welfare Centres ( MCWCs ) in all district and few sub-districts with @card@ bed . DHs have a catchment population of around 2–3 million , while it be 250,000–300,000 for UHCs , 25,000–30,000 for UH&FWCs and 6000–10,000 for CCs . the survey adopt a stratify random sampling procedure where the health facility be stratify accord to their administrative unit and type of facility . all division and the follow type of health facility be include in the survey : DHs , MCWCs , UHCs , UH&FWCs , CCs , and private hospital and Ngo clinic with at least @card@ bed . in BHFS-2017 , datum be successfully collect from @card@ health facility ( @card@ % response rate ) . from each facility , an average of eight health care provider , who provide the range of service be assess , be select for interview . in facility with less than eight health care provider , all provider present on the day of the visit be interview . a total of @card@ provider be interview [ @card@ ] . BHFS @card@ use two type of questionnaire for datum collection : a facility inventory questionnaire and a health care provider interview questionnaire . the facility inventory questionnaire be use to collect datum relate to the service availability and readiness of each priority service . the health care provider interview questionnaire be use to collect information relate to the level of education , training , clinical experience , and supervision receive by a sample of health care provider from each facility . the datum collection team consist of @card@ medical doctor and @card@ paramedic who receive three week of training from @card@ July to @card@ July @card@ in Dhaka . datum be collect between @card@ July and @card@ October @card@ . additional detail be available in the BHFS-2017 report [ @card@ ] . datum be analyse use Stata version @card@ ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) . accord to the national IMCI programme , all DHs , MCWCs , UHCs and UH&FWCs be mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service through outpatient department [ @card@ , @card@ ] . therefore , in this paper , we limit our analysis to DHs ( n = @card@ ) , UHCs ( n = @card@ ) , UH&FWCs ( n = @card@ ) , and MCWCs ( n = @card@ ) , which be consistently use as denominator throughout the analysis . the National Newborn Health Programme and IMCI ( NNHP&IMCI ) of Directorate General of Health Services ( DGHS ) , Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ( MoH&FW ) , Bangladesh have an approve list of essential equipment , drug and logistic for IMCI service in Bangladesh . a consultative workshop be organise with the national expert under the leadership of IMCI Programme to review the IMCI-list and identify item ‘ require ' for pneumonia management base on the facility-basedIMCI guideline . the national expert identify @card@ item as ‘ require ' , which be categorise into four domain : A. staff , B. equipment , C. medicine and D. logistic & job aid . out of these @card@ item , @card@ be available , and three be absent in the BHFS-2017 tool . however , we identify proxy item ( disposable syringe instead of Insulin syringe or 5 cc syringe ; monthly report form instead of IMCI reporting form ) in the tool for two of the absent item . the national expert also identify @card@ item from the list of @card@ required item as essential for manage pneumonia base on facility-based IMCI guideline . supplementary Table 2 present the list of essential item . a ten-point score system be develop to measure the minimum pneumonia management readiness of designate health facility . the availability of each of the essential item be give an equal score of one . then , the facility be categorise as ‘ poor readiness : score 0–4 , ‘ moderate readiness : score 5–7 and ‘ high readiness : score 8–10 . the score system be develop in consultation with national expert and IMCI programme management team . figure 1 summarise the item identify by the Technical Committee and their availability in BHFS @card@ tool . service availability be define as facility offer curative child care and report to provide the service base on facility-based IMCI guideline . readiness be define as the presence of required item list in Fig . 1 on the day of the visit . supplementary Table 1 present the operational definition of readiness for each of the require item . descriptive statistic ( proportion ) be use to report availability and readiness for each item . the estimate be stratify by facility type ( DHs , UHCs , UH&FWCs , MCWCs ) , location ( rural and urban ) and administrative division . in addition to the required and essential item , we present the readiness of IMCI facility regard the oxygen system . in addition to pulse oximetry ( which be already include as a required item ) , the follow item be include for present oxygen system readiness : availability of oxygen concentrator , availability of oxygen cylinder with flow meter , availability of oxygen cylinder without flow meter , and availability of oxygen distribution system . table 1 describe the background characteristic of the public health facility , which be mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh and include in this analysis . all of the DHs and the majority ( @card@ % ) of the MCWCs be situate in urban area . regard UHCs , around half be locate in urban area . in contrast , almost all the UH&FWCs be locate in rural area . among all the facility , around one-fifth be in Barisal and Chittagong division each while rest of the division , contribute around @card@ % each . figure 2 summarise the service availability relate to pneumonia management in public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . curative child care be almost universally available across all type of facility . more than @card@ % of DHs and UHCs report provide IMCI service ( include pneumonia management ) , whereas such service be available in three-fourth of UH&FWCs and MCWCs . around @card@ % of DHs and UHCs have IMCI corner . however , the availability be extremely low ( 9 % ) in MCWCs . UH&FWCs be not mandate to establish specific corner for provide IMCI service ; therefore the finding for this facility have be present as ‘ not applicable ' . figure 3 illustrate the readiness relate to the management of pneumonia in different type of public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . the availability ( on the day of the visit ) be present for each of the item ( present in Fig . 1 ) require for manage pneumonia accord to facility-based IMCI guideline . around @card@ % of the facility have a staff ever train in facility-based IMCI guideline , and @card@ % have a copy of the IMCI chart booklet on the day of the visit . regard equipment , the thermometer be available in @card@ % of facility . weigh scale ( child or infant ) be available in half of the facility . only one-third of the facility have an Ari timer or a watch that can record time in second on the day of the visit . pulse oximetry be available in only 6 % of facility . more than @card@ % of the facility have amoxicillin syrup or dispersible tablet on the day of the visit . however , the availability of injection gentamicin be only @card@ % . an Insulin syringe or disposable 5 cc syringe be available in @card@ % of facility . although monthly reporting form be available in @card@ % of facility , around one-third of the facility do not have an IMCI service register to document their care practice . table 2 present the readiness ( availability of required item on the day of the visit ) relate to the management of pneumonia in public health facility mandate for provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh , disaggregated by facility type , location and division for each of the readiness item . DHs and UHCs demonstrate high level of readiness than UH&FWCs for the majority of the item . the readiness of UH&FWCs be particularly low ( less than half of DHs ) for IMCI chart booklet , weigh scale , Ari timer , pulse oximeter , injection gentamicin , injection diazepam and IMCI register . similarly , the readiness be high among urban-facilities than that of rural-facilities across all item . pulse oximetry be available in only @card@ % of the district hospital and @card@ % of the UHCs . none of the UH&FWCs have a pulse oximeter on the day of the visit . no obvious pattern be observe regard the readiness across different division . more than two-third of UHCs have both IMCI trained staff and guideline , but around a quarter of MCWCs and union facility have both . similar gap be identify of all other domain . figure 4 present the readiness base on ten essential item for manage pneumonia in public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . the score denote the number of item available on the day of the visit . out of the facility survey , only @card@ % have a high level of readiness with an overall readiness score of 8–10 , whereas @card@ % have a low level of readiness with an overall score of 0–4 . when stratify by facility type , DH and UHC show a high level of readiness than that of UH&FWCs ( @card@ % for DHs , @card@ % for UHCs and 8 % for UH&FWCs , p < @card@ ) . facility locate in urban area have a much high level of high readiness ( @card@ % ) than facility locate in rural area ( @card@ % ) ( p < @card@ ) . the readiness pattern be similar across all administrative division . supplementary Figure 1 illustrate that no facility have all of the ten essential item available on the day of the visit . around 5 % of the DHs and UHCs have all essential item , whereas only 1 % of MCWCs and no union facility have all essential item . figure 5 illustrate the readiness relate to oxygen source in public health facility in Bangladesh . around @card@ % of the DHs and one-thirds of the UHCs and MCWCs have a function oxygen concentrator on the day of the visit . more than half ( 52–65 % ) of the DHs , UHCs and MCWCs have oxygen cylinder with flow meter . besides , around half of the DHs and UHCs , and one-third of the MCWCs have oxygen cylinder without flowmeters on the day of the visit . around @card@ % of the district hospital have an oxygen distribution system , but none of UHCs , UH&FWC and MCWCs have this . the availability of any of the four oxygen source be the high in UHCs ( @card@ % ) follow by DHs ( @card@ % ) and MCWCs ( @card@ % ) . oxygen availability be particularly low ( 5 % ) in UH&FWCs . pneumonia be the large killer of child under five year of age in Bangladesh , and IMCI be one of the key strategy adopt by the government of Bangladesh for managing pneumonia [ 3 , @card@ , @card@ ] . the success of IMCI service will greatly influence Bangladesh’s progress towards achieve the GAPPD target of prevent all avoidable pneumonia-related death by @card@ [ 5 ] . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be the step stone for health system strengthening and critical to promote the quality of care render through IMCI service [ @card@ ] . this be the first study to report the service availability and readiness relate to IMCI-based pneumonia service in Bangladesh through a nationally representative sample . this study identify that there be substantial gap in staff train in IMCI service , availability of essential item like functional Ari timer or watch that can record time in second , pulse oximeter , register and report form for documentation , and necessary medicine for provide IMCI-based pneumonia management . moreover , there be critical gap in the availability of oxygen source in the survey facility . who develop the IMCI strategy in the mid-1990 , which incorporate key lesson from WHO’s Global Acute Respiratory Infection Control Programme launch in 1980s [ @card@ ] . the government of Bangladesh adopt the IMCI strategy immediately after that , and the process of health system integration and national scale-up be complete through its inclusion in the National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 and Essential Service Package [ @card@ , @card@ ] . accord to the current National Health Sector Programme 2017–22 , all type of public facility ( DH , UHCs , UH&FWCs and MCWCs ) be mandate to provide curative child care through IMCI service [ @card@ , @card@ ] . our analysis reveal that almost all facility offer child curative service , but there be substantial gap regard the availability of IMCI service in UH&FWCs and MCWCs . the divide between the two directorate of the Ministry of Health and the difference in their strategic focus can potentially explain such contrast picture . all DHs and UHCs be under the DGHS , however , the majority of the UH&FWCs and all MCWCs be under the Directorate General of Family Planning ( DGFP ) [ @card@ , @card@ ] . historically , DGHS be involve in the introduction and scale-up of IMCI service in Bangladesh , and they have a specific programme name after IMCI ( NNHP&IMCI ) . on the other hand , the prime mandate of DGFP be to promote and provide family planning service . child curative care be incorporate into DGFP’s mandate as an expansion of the existing family planning service . also , there be gap in coordination between the IMCI programme of DGHS and the child health programme of DGHS . accord to the current health sector programme , all DHs , UHCs and MCWCs be suppose to prioritise IMCI service by maintain a dedicated corner in the outpatient department [ @card@ , @card@ ] . IMCI corner require dedicated staff ( IMCI train ) , equipment and logistic , which help operationalising outpatient service and retain the skill of the service provider . the IMCI corner also help in manage the high-volume patient flow in DHs , UHCs and MCWCs , and act as a referral link for child who be refer from UH&FWCs . contrary to the policy outline in the health sector programme , 6 % of DHs , @card@ % of UHCs , and more than @card@ % of MCWCs do not have dedicate IMCI corner . the lack of a strategic focus and programmatic investment by DGFP regard IMCI service can potentially explain the low availability of IMCI corner in MCWCs . in addition to the IMCI corner , different programme have recommend maintain various other corner like ANC corner , PNC corner , KMC corner , Scanu corner , NCD Corner , Breast Feeding corner , Via corner etc. in DHs and UHCs [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . the compete interest of various corner can , which be establish as a horizontal integration of various service , be another explanation for the gap in the availability of IMCI corner in facility with limited resource . IMCI adopt a syndromic management approach , where the service provider have to follow various clinical algorithm to classify and treat childhood illness [ @card@ ] . it require continuous in-service training and supportive supervision to retain the knowledge and skill of the service provider and ensure the quality of IMCI service [ @card@ ] . unfortunately , almost half of the survey facility do not have an IMCI trained staff and a copy of the chart booklet . the situation be particularly bad in UH&FWCs and MCWCs . although DHs and UHCs demonstrate a comparatively high level of readiness regard the availability of a service provider ever train in IMCI only around @card@ % of the DHs and approximately one-third of the UHCs have a service provider who receive IMCI training within the past @card@ month [ @card@ ] . it raise a critical concern regard the quality of IMCI service , include management of pneumonia render through the service provider without appropriate training and supervision . it reveal the apparent gap in national programme planning and implementation . the survey ( BHFS ) be conduct in @card@ , which be just after the completion of the previous National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 [ @card@ , @card@ ] . IMCI training organise by the IMCI programme in the last sector programme implementation period be not adequate to the need of the country . since @card@ , the Ministry of Health be implement the current National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 [ @card@ ] . the provision and resource allocation for IMCI training in the operation plan of the current health sector programme be also inadequate and insufficient [ @card@ , @card@ ] . moreover , in the first two year of the current sector programme implementation period ( 2017–19 ) , the IMCI programme do not organise any IMCI training for the old and newly recruit service provider . One of the core component of IMCI strategy be to improve the case-management skill of service provider through the provision of locally adapt IMCI-guidelines and through activity to promote their use . unfortunately , more than half of the survey facility do not have a copy of the chart booklet . moreover , the late version of Bangladesh adapt version of the IMCI chart booklet be base on WHO’s 2008-edition [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in @card@ , who release another version of IMCI chart booklet with major update regard pneumonia classification , treatment recommendation and referral criterion [ @card@ , @card@ ] . during the implementation period of the previous health sector programme ( 2011–16 ) and the first two year of the current health sector programme ( 2017–22 ) , the IMCI programme could not take proper initiative to update the IMCI chart booklet base on WHO’s recent recommendation as well as print and distribute them to the IMCI service delivery point in DHs , UHCs , UH&FWCs and MCWCs . this could substantially affect the safety of treatment and quality of care , particularly for pneumonia and sepsis management . IMCI be design for setting with minimum diagnostic capacity . therefore , the availability of some basic equipment and medicine must be ensure for proper clinical assessment and treatment accord to the guideline [ @card@ ] . assessment of respiratory rate be one of the most important step in IMCI-based pneumonia classification , which eventually determine the management plan , referral decision and treatment outcome [ 34–36 ] . unfortunately , two-third of the designate facility in Bangladesh do not have a functional Ari timer or watch that be able to record time in second . moreover , around half of the facility do not have an appropriate weigh scale which be important for prescribe medicine ( include antibiotic of pneumonia management ) with appropriate dosage [ @card@ ] . the majority of these essential equipment be not costly and be readily available in the local market . therefore , the observed gap in their availability reflect the apparent lack of effective programme planning , coordination and monitoring . the IMCI-based pneumonia management require the availability of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin as the first-line treatment for severe pneumonia and possible serious bacterial infection of young infant [ @card@ , @card@ ] . for more severe case , the availability of both amoxicillin and gentamicin together be essential for prereferral treatment and outpatient-based management ( when applicable ) [ @card@ ] . although the availability of oral amoxicillin be reasonably high among all type of facility , there be substantial gap regard the availability of injectable gentamicin . such critical gap in readiness regard the first-line antibiotic essentially reduce the level of effective coverage , may compromise the level of adherence to guideline and potentially result in avertable pneumonia-related death [ @card@ ] . besides the availability of the IMCI medicine , the choice of antibiotic recommendation by IMCI service provider may be influence by external factor . several study conduct in Bangladesh report that there be substantial gap regard health care provider ' adherence to guideline since many of them prefer high general antibiotic over the first-line recommended antiiotics [ 41–44 ] . documentation be one of the most important part of IMCI service . the IMCI service register be design to capture essential detail on clinical assessment , disease classification , treatment , and referral decision . it act as a job aid to assist the provider in adhere to the guideline and prepare monthly report efficiently [ @card@ ] . register be also link to the overall monitoring and supervision framework lay out for IMCI service , as well as the overall accountability structure [ @card@ , @card@ ] . although register be almost universally available in DHs and UHCs , one-third of UH&FWCs and MCWCs do not have them , accord to our analysis . the lack of availability of IMCI register also raise question regard the validity of datum in monthly report , which be the basis of effective programme plan and monitor for health manager . base on the multi-country evaluation of IMCI , which run from @card@ to @card@ , who release a position paper with a strong recommendation for health system strengthen by ensure the availability of skilled health worker , essential medicine , and supply as a comprehensive package in all IMCI service delivery point [ @card@ ] . the lack of comprehensive readiness , include essential equipment , drug and logistic adversely affect the performance of the IMCI service provider and result in the poor quality of care [ @card@ , @card@ ] . a global survey conduct by who find that the country with a comprehensive implementation status of IMCI be @card@ time be more likely to achieve MDG-4 target than other country who could not adopt a comprehensive approach [ @card@ ] . it be imperative to ensure comprehensive readiness of facility for provide IMCI service , include pneumonia management , by learn lesson from this global evidence . we report substantial gap regard the overall readiness of public facility in Bangladesh pertain to pneumonia management . the readiness of private facility regard IMCI service be equally poor in Bangladesh [ @card@ ] . Less than 1 % of the private facility be identify to be ready for provide child curative service . only @card@ % of private facility have an IMCI trained staff . without address these gap , it will not be possible to adhere to the who quality of care standard relate to the provision of care and experience of care [ @card@ ] . the lack of comprehensive readiness , include essential equipment , drug and logistic adversely affect the performance of the IMCI service provider and result in the poor quality of care [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the readiness be much bad in lower-level facility and facility locate in rural area . the low level facility ( UH&FWCs ) be mostly locate in rural area and serve as the first point of contact for the poor and more disadvantaged section of the population . thus , the low level of overall readiness in these facility further contribute to the existing inequity in access to and utilisation of appropriate health service in Bangladesh and other low- and middle-income country [ 2 , 49–51 ] . accord to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2017–18 , only @card@ % of the under 5 child with symptom of acute respiratory infection seek care from public health facility [ @card@ ] . the poor level of readiness of public facility may explain the low care-seeking practice from public health facility . Hypoxaemia be common among child with pneumonia and be one of the strong predictor of mortality due to acute low respiratory infection [ 53–55 ] . integration of SpO2 assessment in exist IMCI service can significantly improve the accuracy of hypoxemia assessment and increase the validity ( accuracy ) of pneumonia classification ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in response to the need and global evidence , who recommend measure SpO2 in routine IMCI service ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in addition , oxygen security be a vital concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . the government of Bangladesh adopt the who recommendation and decide to introduce pulse oximetry in IMCI service for SpO2 assessment [ @card@ ] . although the survey predate the government of Bangladesh’s policy adoption regard SpO2 assessment in IMCI service , it be helpful to understand the baseline situation of the country in this regard . Less than one-tenth of the facility have pulse oximetry . the availability of pulse oximetry be not optimal even in referral hospital as less than one-third of the DHs and one-fifth of the UHCs have readiness in this regard . this be similar to the status of many other low- and middle country with limited resource [ @card@ ] . To achieve the universal availability of pulse oximetry in all IMCI service contact point , the government of Bangladesh need to prioritise its procurement and efficiently manage its distribution . in addition to ensure the availability of pulse oximetry , it be equally important to ensure the availability of oxygen in referral hospital to aggressively correct and manage hypoxaemia [ @card@ , @card@ ] . unfortunately , one-third of the DHs and one-fourth of the UHCs do not have a reliable oxygen source which be essential for manage child with hypoxaemia . effective oxygen therapy require not only prompt and accurate detection of hypoxaemia but also appropriate administration of oxygen , combine with good clinical evaluation and management of the underlie condition . Bangladesh can learn from other low- and middle-income country that have strategically invest in oxygen security in referral hospital and effectively reduce the burden of mortality due to pneumonia [ @card@ , @card@ ] . experience from four decade of ‘ oxygen project ' show that effective improvement of oxygen system in low-resource setting be possible but be complex and require context-specific technical , clinical , and managerial solution [ @card@ ] . it be important to discuss some of the strength and limitation of this study . BHFS-2017 be conduct with a nationally representative sample allow us to generate specific estimate by facility type , location and division . moreover , the datum collection tool use in BHFS-2017 be validate and adapt to the national context through expert consultation . the survey present a snapshot of the service availability and readiness of the survey facility since it only consider the availability of service and item on the day of the visit . information regard service availability be base on the self-reported status of the facility . regard readiness , the datum collector physically verify the availability of required and essential item and assess their functionality where applicable . although there be no globally validate criterion for assess the service availability and readiness relate to pneumonia management , we go through an expert consultation process under the leadership of IMCI programme in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to develop the service availability and readiness criterion for Bangladesh . the expert identify the list of required and essential item as well as the score system base on consensus and under the leadership of the national IMCI programme . although the list and the score system be not validate externally , they reflect the national programme priority . lastly , we acknowledge that the gap in service availability and readiness may be result from broad health system build block issue such as health financing and governance . the availability of datum do not allow us to explore and present such root cause , which need to be explore through future research in this field . our study finding report low to moderate level of readiness for provide IMCI-based pneumonia management in public health facility in Bangladesh . the readiness be significantly poor among rural and lower-level facility . achieve the ambitious target of avert all preventable pneumonia-related mortality by @card@ will require effective coverage of pneumonia management with appropriate quality of care from the government and support from global level partner . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be the first step towards promote effective coverage and be integral to WHO’s quality of care framework . there be substantial gap in the availability of IMCI service and readiness of essential item require for pneumonia management in public health facility in Bangladesh . the situation be significantly bad in the low level and rural facility . Bangladesh should make substantial effort to improve programme planning , implementation , and monitor to address these critical gap to ensure good provision of care for child suffer from pneumonia . moreover , as IMCI have be scale up in Bangladesh , there be a need for research on improve delivery strategy and overcome barrier to implementation .   Covid-19 : a test for our humanity the Covid-19 pandemic be not a war zone of combat and compete interest , but a ‘ test of our humanity ' , as the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier say in his television speech on @card@ April @card@ . this be as time of carefully address ethical principle that both guide and challenge act and policy , to investigate how these principle contribute to uphold humanity , and how they inform us about unsolvable dilemma . these be time we have to act even though we might make the wrong decision . part of test our humanity be prepare ourselves to face the wrong decision that be make in time of uncertainty . there seem to be confusion about what contribute to humanity . all over the world , group claim that their humanity be under pressure because their right to freedom be restrict . but , be it the loss of some liberty that threaten humanity , or be it a sign of humanity that some take burden to protect other ? for some , herd immunity be the magic word to reach a most humane strategy : the idea that if only enough people fall ill to Covid-19 and recover , base on their antibody the disease can spread anymore . yet , to reach herd immunity through a population-wide experienced disease , rather than vaccination , also mean , to at least accept that some people will not fully recover from Covid-19 or even die . other argue that to prepare our health care facility be a sign of humanity . in the heat of the crisis , image of quickly erect hospital capture an undercurrent of implicit bias towards an idea that ‘ right to healthcare ' can be narrow to ‘ a right to ICU care ' . question about access to scarce good like protective clothing get a different understanding when heart-breaking appeal to our humanity from staff of care- and nursing home draw attention to question about who’s protect whom ( e. g. supply of protective clothing ) and to what end ( health vs. family value ) ? we contend that we need a moral language that offer conceptual clarity and do not shy away from normative guidance in this ‘ test of humanity ' . it be necessary to identify ethical principle and rule that inform what claim be justify and consequently need to be act upon . we propose the use of seven ethical principle that , in no particular hierarchical order , shed light on the problem at hand . these principle structure the question we face and offer a framework of what at least should be address when try to reach decision defensible and transparent decision . the principle that play a role in analyse the ethic of Covid-19 be population health maximization , justice , autonomy , harm avoidance ( ‘ harm principle ' ) , public trust , solidarity and reciprocity and protection of the vulnerable . these principle , base on the six principle in Schröder-Bäck et al . @card@ with the addition of the vulnerability principle be briefly explain in table 1 . Covid-19 have affect everybody’s life but not in equal way . in many European country resident in long-term care facility ( LTCF ) be affect in various way : fail report , limited testing , shortage of protective measure , infectious staff , lack of training and lock down for visitors.2 the principle of population health maximization demand monitor system that include the entire population , i. e. , include resident in LTCF . Justice require non-discrimination : where you reside should not matter , and age be not a valid argument as such . the vulnerability principle ask for specific identification of who be vulnerable to what3 : not all elderly people be equally vulnerable ( high socioeconomic-status still offer good protection ) and vulnerability can be enhance by the decision other people make . consequently , responsibility need to be specify , e. g. , ‘ outbreak management team ' have to give dedicated specialist the power to act upon the specific identify vulnerability . have these dedicated specialists—with a keen eye for the patient and public engagement4—contribute to trustworthy policy . once the argument result from these principle be arrange , the question result from the principle of solidarity and reciprocity can be address : how much burden can be expect from different group and who ought to be give some leeway ? finally , give the analysis base on the previous principle , the public need to be inform to enable their autonomous decision-making about , e. g. , support or protest the isolation of people in LTCF . finally , we want to call upon the public health community not to shy away from openly discuss the moral distress.5 the Covid-19 pandemic cause . we need to collect the storey about the situation where member of the public health community be hinder in do what be the ethically appropriate action due to circumstance beyond their control , for example , institutionalize impediment . share these storey be necessary first of all to avoid discouragement on both an individual and organizational level . secondly , it create insight into what the public health community deem as ‘ ethically appropriate action ' . thirdly , these situation of moral distress be a treasure trove for an evaluation of where and when system ‘ test our humanity ' . conflict of interest : none declare .   family in the time of the pandemic : breakdown or Breakthrough ? COVID‐19 have impact economic , educational , employment , financial , mental and physical health , social , spiritual , and many other developmental aspect of family and community , certainly in way that we be uncomfortably unfamiliar with . social distancing and lockdown measure have result in force proximity among family member and have disconnect individual from their support network ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ; Van Bavel et al . , @card@ ) . To compound the situation further , pre‐existing and new macro‐system development such as political and social movement and natural disaster continue to interplay with this pandemic in many part of the world . One such example be the US presidential election and the United States ' economic war with China , which have repercussion on different front , include socioeconomic and political context . moreover , the impact of the pandemic and the challenge of the macro system intersect with stressful condition and unfair bias arise from racism , sexism , poverty , and other form of oppression . hence , vulnerable group , such as people of a certain age , economic status , or race be more adversely affect during a try time like this ( Twigg , @card@ ) . conversely , it be not difficult to imagine how inequality spread COVID‐19 ( Ahmed , Ahmed , Pissarides , & Stiglitz , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . there be a plethora of contemporary systemic literature that focus on the COVID‐19 pandemic as the source of multiple stress affect global and mental health for family , include loss of life , loss of social and physical contact , loss of employment and financial security , loss of hope and dream , and loss of normalcy ( see , e. g. , Walsh , @card@ ) . moreover , anxiety , depression , fear , grief , trauma , difficulty in adaptation ( e. g. , sleep and eating pattern ) , and relationship conflict be some of the bio‐psycho‐social challenge face individual and their family during the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Amorin‐Woods et al . , @card@ ; Falicov , Nino , & D’urso , @card@ ; Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . this situation be further worsen by conflicting public information ( see Gunthe et al . ( @card@ ) for a review ) , as well as the uncertainty that family may experience either directly or indirectly ( Lee , @card@ ; Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . all of these condition and stressors could further exacerbate one another ( Walsh , @card@ ) . when we be invite to contribute to this special issue of the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Family therapy , we think it provide a valuable opportunity to reflect on our clinical practice over the course of this extraordinary year . during this time , there have be a burgeon literature about the impact\n",
            "of COVID‐19 on family and couple relationship . by bring together some aspect of the literature with our clinical practice , our specific goal be to examine the unique challenge and opportunity of COVID‐19 for family at different life developmental stage , as well as the challenge and opportunity for systemic therapist as they venture into unfamiliar territory beyond the comfort of their physical therapy room , without a clear map , when they practice online ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ) . we will start with a composite case example of the Smith family which be base , loosely , on the first author 's clinical practice in London . however , we believe that the case capture some of the feature and dilemma that multigenerational family – all over the world – be face during these unprecedented time . we will use the case example to illustrate key systemic theoretical idea that we have be draw on in our practice , link up the idea with the current systemic literature , describe the process of work with the Smith family , and end by outline the clinical implication , challenge , and opportunity for family and therapist . John and Siew be an intercultural , professional couple in their 40s . they have two child – Lian ( @card@ ) and Mark ( @card@ ) . Siew’s 78‐year‐old mother , who be originally from China , live with the family . Siew suffer from diabetes and develop COVID‐19 . she be extremely ill but manage to survive . since then , she have be suffer from ‘ Long COVID ' ( Venkatesan , @card@ ) . John and the child have be shield Siew and her mother . they have not be able to leave the house and the child have be school online . Lian be worry about her A‐level result and whether she will be able to attend university . as she be at home , she be the main carer for her mother , grandmother , and young brother . Mark be miss his friend and spend excessive time play video game . Siew’s mother miss her sibling and friend back in China . she be extremely upset by the racism that their family face because of their Chinese origin . Mark , who look more Chinese than his sister , be often the subject of racial harassment online . John find the pressure within the family and in his work situation impossible to manage . he turn to misuse alcohol . conflict erupt between the couple , and have escalate into intimate partner violence . in work with the Smith family , we draw on Mason’s ( @card@ ) classic and seminal text and its subsequent revision ( @card@ ) on safe uncertainty . there be uncertainty at every level for the Smith family , as even the act of leave the house for any one of the family member be deem unsafe . food delivery and any package come into the house need to be carefully disinfect ; fear of contamination lead to possible transmission of COVID‐19 be an ongoing concern . at another level , there be chronic uncertainty about future event , for example , whether Lian would be able to fulfill her cherished dream of go to university , or whether John’s employment would continue . within this domain of unsafe uncertainty , family member position could become polarise . Siew and her mother represent a position of be careful to the point of be phobic , whereas John be position as be careless about hygiene and social distancing . the polarise position seem to reflect discourse in society ( and even nation ) in their way of respond to this pandemic . within the systemic literature it be note that perhaps the big challenge of work with individual , couple , and family during COVID‐19 be that of uncertainty ( Lee , @card@ ; Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . Transmission of COVID‐19 be invisible . infected individual can be asymptomatic and yet contagious . even when vaccine become available , the way COVID‐19 may continue in different part of the world and its implication be unknown . the impact of these uncertainty on people 's health and psychosocial well‐being be beyond the experience of most . moreover , these uncertainty further impact the essential service and system that family depend on , such as business , education , employment , financial , housing , medical , social care and security , transport , travel , and other system . disconnection from workplace , school , medical and public service , and social service for family member with special need generate further complication and uncertainty for many family ( Mclintosh , @card@ ) . Walsh ( @card@ ) aptly describe this period as ‘ shatter assumption ' ( page @card@ ) , where the taken‐for‐granted belief and expectation about our life and our connection to our world no longer hold . the context of unsafe uncertainty seem recursively link to unsafe or dangerous family and couple interaction . the escalation of family and couple violence may be particularly difficult for family who may not have access to resource , such as those who live in small space . during the pandemic , home may become a hothouse of interaction during a time when there be limited possibility for escape into the outside world ( Lebow , @card@ ; Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . family relationship may become tense due to force proximity as a result of quarantine measure , especially for those who live in close quarter . sadly , datum around the world , include from China , France , Brazil , and Italy , report up to a @card@ % increase in incident of domestic violence during the pandemic ( Campbell , @card@ ) . many of these incident may be due to ‘ situational couple violence , ' in which conflict that usually do not involve physical violence have escalate due to added stress and unrelenting proximity ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ; University of Nevada , @card@ ) . moreover , the need to quarantine with partner and family member despite there be conflict , or even violence , before the pandemic can be even more challenging . family boundary become more diffuse , both physically and psychologically , and relationship conflict become more frequent and intense , because they be no longer mitigate by daily activity such as go to work and school . notably , there be little documentation about child abuse , parent abuse , and even poly‐victimisation ( Chan , @card@ ) , that be , more than one type of abuse happen within the family . safety be paramount when work with different type of family during the COVID‐19 pandemic . Stanley and Markman ( @card@ ) poignantly articulate four type of safety in order for relationship to thrive : physical , emotional , commitment , and community . notably , in family that be experience abuse , violence , or divorce there may be a strong possibility of either physical or emotional danger for family member ( Lebow , @card@ ; Vetere , @card@ ) . Prior to the pandemic , visit family member or neighbour , and attend religious gathering be often important psychosocial protective factor . during the pandemic , the need to maintain social distance curtail protective in‐person family and community connection . this may place increase stress on the internal dynamics of couple and family relationship at home as their community connection shrink . increase use of electronic or other emerge way to connect help many couple to maintain their network and social capital ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . conversely , increase use of online activity may also create tension between parent and their child ( Lin , @card@ ) . in the Smith family , during the first lockdown period , Siew accuse John of ‘ want to kill her ' by not disinfect their food adequately , lead to a violent argument between the two . argument would also break out between John and Mark over his excessive gaming , which make him rude and defiant . How can we as clinician help couple and family negotiate these struggle so that they can take sensible precaution while embrace uncertainty ? Later in this article , we will outline the way in which we work in order to shift the Smith family to a place of safe uncertainty . the pandemic have affect family at every stage of the developmental life cycle , from infancy to death . further , ritual that mark the transition from one family life‐cycle stage to another may be disrupt . as a result of pandemic social distancing measure , there be substantial disruption of life plan and ritual such as birthday , wedding , religious holiday , recreational activity , and funeral ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . this may have a formidable impact on family process . for instance , family whose member die while hospitalise be not able to be at their deathbed , and in many case be unable to follow ritual prescribe by their religion ( Frayer , Estrin , & Arraf , @card@ ) . this may be particularly pronounce for migrant family , who would not be able to travel back ‘ home ' to grieve or mourn the loss of their kin . COVID‐19 have additional special meaning for different type of family . for example , for family contemplate divorce , divorce , or carry out post‐divorce arrangement , COVID‐19 may potentiate the stress and challenge involve ( Lebow , @card@ ) . during lockdown , acrimony and distance readily increase for family that be already experience tension , and the legal system be either not open or proceed with a major backlog of case that can make this often uncertain and turbulent process even more challenge ( Lebow , @card@ ) . in the case of the Smith family , Lian could not make the transition to the leave home stage of the family life cycle as she be not sure whether she could go to university . her grandmother be in a state of constant grief , anxiety , and preemptive grief , have learn of the death of two close relative back in China . the Social GRRRAAACCEEEESS ( Burnham , @card@ ) be a mnemonic that have help family and systemic psychotherapist keep in mind the intersect aspect of social difference . the GRRAAACCEEEESS currently stand for Gender , Geography , Race , Religion , Age , Ability , Appearance , Class , Culture , ethnicity , Education , Employment , Sexuality , sexual orientation , and Spirituality . COVID‐19 have have a differential impact on different nation and different group in society . vulnerable group , such as racial and ethnic minority , the poor and the old , and those who have have physical and mental challenge before or during the pandemic , have be most hard hit ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . for example , many be in job that put them at risk of be infect , unlike those who have a buffer of saving , or pay leave , or who could work from home . small child may show anxious cling or need constant contact while adolescent may distance ( Walsh , @card@ ) . many family with special need child ( e. g. , autism , cerebral palsy , intellectual disability ) or adult ( e. g. , serious mental disorder , acquire brain injury ) be adapt to the COVID‐19 without the usual specialise supportive and educational service ( Rolland , @card@ ) . this often mean that family member , particularly female family member , may be overburden ( United Nations , @card@ ) . the Social GRRAAACCCEEESS play out within the Smith family , at many level . Siew , be from a minority ethnic background and with underlie health difficulty , be at increase risk for COVID‐19 . further , Siew’s mother’s age make her even more vulnerable . Siew 's and the children’s Chinese origin put them at risk for be discriminate against , especially at a time when there be considerable ‘ othering ' in the wide sociopolitical context . work with the Smith family start in March @card@ ( coincide with the first lockdown in London ) and be ongoing . it have be challenging and difficult , and working online have add to the complexity . I ( RS ) have work with different subsystem in the family and have bring the whole family together during some of the online session . in an early session with the parent , John and Siew be able to voice their anxiety – about COVID‐19 , about the child , about Siew’s mother , and about work and the future . use Tomm’s ( 1987a , 1987b , @card@ , @card@ ) technique of interview the internalise other , I help them both to appreciate the other’s position . John be able to understand Siew’s preoccupation with hygiene and contamination and Siew be able to empathise with the myriad pressure to which John be subject . draw on Vetere’s ( @card@ ) work , I coach John in how to negotiate space apart from the family when he be in a state of arousal and need to calm down . Siew be able to express her need for dependency whilst be able to allow John to take space away from her , in order to calm down . a turn point come in June @card@ , when John think that Siew be go to die of COVID‐19 , and realise how much she mean to him . redistribute role and responsibility within the family free Lian from her position of have to take on the role of the main carer . Siew learn how to simplify household task and expectation and be able to rely on her mother to help more in the house . I mediate between the adult and the young people to put in place a contract with specific time for Mark to be allow to play video game , conditional on his exercise every day outside the house and complete academic task and household chore . I address the wide context of racism for the family , and John be able to take on a stance of protect his family from racism . the child be teach how to defend themselves , and each other , from racial abuse by their peer group . it be more difficult for the family to talk about their experience of racism from within . be there time , in the current context , when the child feel ashamed of their Chinese heritage ? How be the political and economic struggle between China and the West play out in the relationship between John and Siew ? it be vital to create a safe space where these difficult conversation could be have . grandmother and parent be encourage to recount family of origin script when cope with adversity in their own family history ( Mason , @card@ ) . John be able to think about his parent ' storey from the Second World War and Siew’s mother be able to draw on her own experience from Communist China . the storey be use to strengthen resilience within the family . as the work progress , the family be able to create their own ritual around spend meaningful family time together . John put in boundary between work life and home life , and Siew and her mother engage in Zoom conversation and event with family in China and all over the world . the violence between the couple abate . they begin to enjoy the moment ; keep themselves and their family safe , despite the flux in the political context around them – hence operate from a place of safe uncertainty ( Mason , @card@ , @card@ ) . the Smith family be currently look forward to Chinese New year , to the prospect of the vaccination , and to the arrival of spring ! we hope that in describe the process of the work with the Smith family , we have be able to highlight the opportunity the pandemic have afford family . on the one hand , home confinement can easily create condition for conflict or estrangement as household member readjust work , school , and recreational activity ; face possible contagion and financial strain ; and spend virtually all of their time together in limited physical space . on the other hand , such proximity might also create opportunity for increase closeness , communal problem solve , and deep personal relationship , depend on certain condition ; conjugal relation during lockdown appear to be more harmonious when there be no child in the household ( Gunther‐Bel et al . , @card@ ) . Falicov et al . ( @card@ ) find that family that be under‐resourced can be more adaptive in cope with the pandemic as they be use to endure different challenge in life relate to poverty , crowd , and confinement problem , compare to well‐resourced family . this be in keep with Mason’s ( @card@ ) question of family of origin script in cope with adversity and help family to make connection between these transgenerational storey and the current context . reinvent old ritual or create new routine through the use of technology ( Imber‐Black , @card@ ) be an opportunity for family to come together through creative and concerted effort . these ritual may be relate to family tradition ( e. g. , spring holiday ) , or they may be spiritual or developmental ( e. g. , graduation , birthday , and death ) . for example , visit grandparent regularly or celebrate their birthday via Zoom , or clap hand to pay tribute to frontline health worker on a nightly basis , or even national day celebration online , be shine example of old ritual reinvent and new one that have add mean to individual , family , and even community during this challenging time . notably , these ritual require individual and family to come together to plan and execute . COVID‐19 have give family opportunity to assess whether their relationship and lifestyle before the pandemic be ‘ normal ' , for example , the amount of time spend together and time spend do different thing . it have also provide a chance for family to reconsider the ratio of togetherness and autonomy go forward ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . in think more deeply about the ‘ old normal ' and the ‘ New Normal ' we realise that many aspect of our pre‐COVID life that be normalise need to be change for the well . as we expand our vision beyond our personal struggle , we see a need for broad systemic change with more urgency ( Walsh , @card@ , page @card@ ) . the pandemic have also create unique challenge and opportunity for us as therapist . when consider uncertainty and safety , practitioner need to be cognisant of the intersectionality of the COVID‐19 pandemic and large context before , during , and even after the pandemic ( Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . these include at least the cultural , economic , historical , political , and social factor that may compound the impact of the pandemic . therapist need to consider adequately how macrosystemic issue be intrinsically interweave with the experience of individual and family during COVID‐19 ( Rolland , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ; Watson et al . , @card@ ) . for example , COVID‐19 hit the United Kingdom when it be contend with the uncertainty of Brexit , while Hong Kong be still in the midst of the social movement that bring it to the attention of the world . during the pandemic , the economic war between the United States and China have probably intensify the economic pressure of family beyond these two economic power house . meanwhile , the Black Lives Matter movement intensify racial relation all over the world , which correspond with the racism direct towards Asian when COVID‐19 initially begin in different country ( Sim , @card@ ; Watson et al . , @card@ ) . natural disaster do not stop before or during the pandemic and surely will not stop after , and some family in different part of the world have to deal with both natural disaster and the pandemic . therefore , therapist need to appreciate that while family cope with the pervasive impact of COVID‐19 on a day‐to‐day basis in relation to education , financial , health , and other issue , they may already be deal with pre‐existing illness or disability or racial and socioeconomic disparity ( Rolland , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ) . such a predicament become much bad if at least one family member have be infect by COVID‐19 . in addition , it would be pertinent for therapist to appreciate the issue with which famile be contend that be compound by large context , such as the possible polarisation of couple and family member due to social movement during the pandemic ( Sahebi , @card@ ) . Watson et al . ( @card@ , page @card@ ) vehemently state : … unless we pay close attention to the impact of racism , classism , colonization , environmental injustice , and collective trauma during this pandemic crisis now and for many year after , as family therapist we would also be perpetuate the cycle of discrimination . furthermore , different family member , different family , and different section of society , particularly low income and minority family , may experience the current situation differently and this be likely to lead to factionalism and polarise position rather than a communal ethic of work together ( Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ) . during this pandemic , most therapy move online . One of the way in which this pandemic have open up new opportunity be that more individual , couple , and family have be force to become comfortable with virtual contact and telehealth system ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ) . notably , the practice of teletherapy ( also refer to as telehealth , telemental health , telemedicine , telepsychology , or telepsychiatry ) be neither new nor uncommon , and be grow before the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . in view of its increase use , counsel and psychotherapy association around the world begin provide guideline for online practice ( e. g. , American Psychological Association , @card@ , @card@ ; British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy , @card@ ) . in the field of couple and family therapy , there be already clear guideline develop before COVID‐19 take the field by surprise ( AAMFTS , @card@ ; Blumer et al . , @card@ ; Shaw , @card@ ) . One of the most commonly discuss challenge of teletherapy relate to confidentiality and the loss of immediate physical presence , which exclude non‐verbal communication , which therapist spend year learn to discern and utilise ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ) . the debate about teletherapy , though ongoing , need to develop further . for instance , there may be a need to scrutinise relevant issue relate to teletherapy such as its effectiveness , or identify the commonality and idiosyncratic issue of teletherapy and conduct therapy in a room . Could there be a good blend between two or more form of therapy on‐ and offline , at which stage , and with whom ? moreover , debate and issue relate to develop relevant systemic couple and family teletherapy curriculum , core competence , supervision , and evaluation be challenge the field must take on urgently . What about family who may not have access to the Internet ? there be a range of issue link to ‘ telesupervision ' ( Sahebi , @card@ ) during COVID‐19 , such as structural change and technological adaptation of supervision , new boundary and supervisory role , the supervisory alliance , and both the supervisor ' and supervisees ' vulnerability in the face of COVID‐19 , to name a few . a group of systemic family therapist and their intern believe that , while online supervision be novel and not without advantage , ‘ there be no replacement for direct , in‐person interaction , and continue to regard the in‐person live supervision practicum as our preferred way of conduct therapy and supervision ' ( Nathan et al . , @card@ , page @card@ ) . there be an increase evidence base for telehealth psychology and psychotherapy for different population and mental health issue include veteran and civilian PTSD , obesity management , parent , and adolescent obsessive compulsive disorder ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . online application of couple and family therapy have also be find recently ( see Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ for a review ) . there be many advantage to telehealth psychotherapy service . these include : improve availability of service in rural and remote area , and for client group experience difficulty leave the home ( e. g. , client with agoraphobia , stigmatise group , family of child with traumatic brain injury , etc. ) ; enhance capacity for client to choose a clinician with specific expertise ; reduce time wait for an appointment ; less time off work to attend the appointment ; and increase flexibility in appointment time and location ( Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . with regard to the challenge associate with use technology , one of the major challenge that need to be urgently resolve be that some family do not have access to the Internet or have limit capability in use the Internet and related application . many of these family may also be experience dire situation relate to violence , mental health , racism , and so on ( Sim , @card@ ) . this may require couple and family therapist to innovatively use other mean that be safe , legitimate , and culturally sensitive , such as promote other support that be available within the family and the community ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . more importantly , in deal with this ‘ wicked problem ' that have leave the world with no immediate or ultimate solution ( Rittel & Webber , @card@ ) , this call for couple and family therapist to work closely with other professional collaboratively and be willing to learn and listen ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . as Dickerson ( @card@ , page @card@ ) suggest , therapist should look out for opportunity : by utilize our experience and expertise as system thinker , we can , in a disciplined way , improvise a response to the situation . we need to be nimble , able to think outside the box , and ready for the unexpected and unpredictable . these be difficult and challenging contextual , legal , and professional issue that may affect different therapy model and the place we work and live in differently . therapist must not rush , as speed have no speed . perhaps the beautiful Latin proverb ‘ Festina Lente ' and the Greek ‘ Σπεῡδε Βραδέως , ' which mean ‘ hasten slowly , ' may bring to bear the consideration of care as we work on these challenge move forward . but surely these challenge present us with many opportunity in the field . a fundamental systemic principle be that change in context impose new constraint and lift other ( Pinsof et al . , @card@ ) . conduct couple and family therapy online be a huge change in context for both the family and the therapist , and bring both challenge and opportunity . whilst couple and family therapist attempt to make a difference for family , they too may be face compete demand in work from home , include rapid role shift and manage distraction , and may be struggle with the same fear and constraint as the individual and family they be attempt to help ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ; Sahebi , @card@ ) . the need for therapist to care for themselves be essential , especially if they increasingly have to work online , where the boundary between real life and the online world become less define . on a more pragmatic level , in maintain interpersonal relationship Falicov et al . ( @card@ ) suggest that therapist replace physical expression of affection with care word during COVID‐19 , where appropriate . these include ‘ I hope you and yours stay healthy and safe , ' or ‘ I hope you all don’t worry too much , ' or even ‘ I send hug to all of you . ' a statement from a therapist to client such as ‘ know that you can always call on me ' may have more poignant implication during uncertain time . Fraenkel and Cho ( @card@ ) believe that therapist must go beyond traditional psychotherapeutic intervention to meet the challenge of this pandemic . Imber‐Black ( @card@ ) poignantly observe that ritual bend and do not break during COVID‐19 , and suggest therapist work with couple and family in develop simple new ritual to stay connect . in a similar vein , Walsh ( @card@ ) suggest therapist innovatively help family to increase their resilience by focus on the powerful influence of family belief system in ‘ bounce forward ' ( page @card@ ) . use a multisystemic framework with due consideration of life course development and multigenerational issue , Rolland ( @card@ ) suggest therapist and health‐care clinician provide timely family‐oriented consultation and psychoeducation , while attend to their own self‐care . Watson et al . ( @card@ ) invite family therapist to think globally about individual issue at large and suggest a just‐based framework for family therapist to address challenge relate to health inequity , economic insecurity , environmental injustice , and collective trauma . in her muse from a Zen perspective , Lee ( @card@ ) seem convince that if people be less certain about their claim in their struggle with relationship problem during the pandemic , they may realise that what they be do be not to their benefit , thereby open up new room for change . and when feeling stick in therapy , Lee simply suggest : ‘ let us go and drink some tea ! ' ( page @card@ ) . we be impress with the current literature publish within a short time . but we be certain there will be more literature as the COVID‐19 pandemic continue to play out and as we continue to find different way to cope with it . in try time such as these , there need to be new direction and solution in family therapy and family science , particularly since the context for family functioning , practice , and research have change drastically during the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ) . family therapist and researcher have already start make timely effort to examine what can be do in practice and research , such as the development of new scale ( e. g. , Behar‐Zusman et al . , @card@ ) or new way of conduct family research rigorously during COVID‐19 when safety be an issue among a plethora of challenge ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ) . however , these be early day for understand the longstanding impact of COVID‐19 on individual , couple , family , group , community , country , and the world . more research and critical reflection be need as the pandemic unravel and hit country in wave ; it be highly likely that COVID‐19 will change the way we do thing in the future , although some be more predictable than other ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . at the same time , the context will continue to evolve . we must prepare to break through another new coronavirus or other situation that will call for us to work closely together .   decrease prealbumin level be associate with increase risk of mortality in hospitalize elderly patient with COVID-19 the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) epidemic be cause by an infection with a novel coronavirus , officially name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-COV-2)1 . the infection spread rapidly on all continent and be declare a pandemic by the World Health Organization . as of April @card@ , @card@ , @card@ document case be report worldwide , and @card@ patient have die . as there be currently no specific treatment and medication against the new virus , it be crucial to identify risk factor of severe prognosis . old patient have poor prognostic factor and be more likely to experience critical disease2 , 3 . base on recent statistical datum of China , among patient who be @card@ year and old , the mortality rate be @card@ % , which be significantly high than that of young patient at @card@ . the proportion of death over @card@ year old account for @card@ % of the total death in the national wide , which implicate age people be more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-25 . till present there be rare report in literature focus on the risk factor for poor outcome of the elderly patient with COVID-19 . Serum prealbumin , know as transthyretin , its level may be lower not only by malnutrition , but also by inflammation and aging6 , 7 . compare to albumin , prealbumin have a short half-life , a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis , and predictable catabolic rate ; hence , it may be a more sensitive indicator8 . however , whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalize COVID-19 elderly patient need to be further elucidate . the present study aim to describe the clinical characteristic and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in-hospital mortality , which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality . we design this study as a retrospective cohort study design . the elderly patient with COVID-19 who be admit to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January @card@ to February @card@ , @card@ be consecutively include . this study be approve by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital ( Approval Number : TJ-IRB20200328 ) , and be comply with the Declaration of Helsinki . the datum be anonymous and the study be observational , so the informed consent be not gather . a flow-diagram illustrate patient selection be describe in Figure 1 . inclusion criterion include elderly patient ( ≥ @card@ year old ) diagnose with COVID-19 infection . a total of @card@ participant have be obtain . patient have missing baseline or outcome datum , die on admission or be transfer to other designate hospital during hospitalization be exclude . there be @card@ patient be include in the final analysis . Data collection of participant be perform use hospital electronic medical record system . information include medical history , demographic datum , physical examination , and hematological , biochemical , radiological and microbiological evaluation result be review . the data collection form be review independently by 2 researcher ( CL and LYY ) . blood examination be assess at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital follow standard operative procedure . the routine blood test be analyze use Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer ( Sysmex , Kobe , Japan ) . the Cobas C8000 ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) be use to measure the biochemical parameter . coagulation test be detect by STA-R Max coagulation analyzer ( Diagnostica Stago , Saint-Denis , France ) . throat swab sample be collect and be test for SARS-CoV-2 with commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) kit from DAAN Gene ( Guangzhou , China)9 . the diagnostic criterion and all clinical procedure in this study follow “ diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus ( Trial version 1 to 7 ) promulgate by the National Health and Health Commission of China . summary statistic of baseline characteristic of all patient and stratification by prealbumin tertiles be express as frequency and proportion for categorical variable , mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) ( Gaussian distribution ) or median ( range ) ( skewed distribution ) for continuous variable , and as percentage for categorical variable . the difference between group be analyze use the χ2 ( categorical variable ) , One-Way ANOVA test ( normal distribution ) , or Kruskal-Whallis H test ( skewed distribution ) . we examine the relationship of the prealbumin as categorize into tertiles with the outcome of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model be use to evaluate these relationship , then unadjusted and adjusted odd ratio ( ORs ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CIs ) be calculate . model 1 be the minimally-adjusted model with only sociodemographic variable adjust . model 2 be the fully-adjusted model with covariates include age , sex , smoking status , history of hypertension , history of coronary heart disease , history of diabetes , history of chronic kidney disease , history of carcinoma , history of chronic liver disease , neutrophil , lymphocyte , prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , d-dimer , alanine transaminase , aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , C-reactive protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio . we calculate odd ratio ( ORs ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CIs ) . the high tertile be the reference for prealbumin . we perform test for linear trend by enter the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity . To ensure the robustness of our result , we also perform stratify analysis with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratify by gender , age , hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline . generalize additive model be use to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcome ( all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ) . modeling be perform with the statistical software package R ( http : //www . R-project . org , the R Foundation ) and EmpowerStats ( http : //www . empowerstats . com , X&Y Solutions , Inc , Boston , Ma ) . P value less than @card@ ( two-sided ) be consider statistically significant . in our study , @card@ case be exclude . To avoid selection bias due to missing datum , we perform a sensitivity analysis . the result show that there be no statistical difference between miss group and non-missing group ( supplemental table 1 ) . of @card@ elderly inpatient include in the final analysis , the mean age be @card@ ( @card@ ) year , range from @card@ year to @card@ year , and most patient be male ( table 1 ) . the baseline characteristic of these include participant be list in table1 . the day of sample drawing after admission be @card@ ± @card@ day . no significant statistical difference in sex , smoking status , body weight , BMI , comorbidity ( hypertension , coronary heart disease , chronic kidney disease , cerebral vascular disease , carcinoma , chronic liver disease ) , symptom ( fever , cough , headache , diarrhea and myalgia/fatigue at admission ) be detect across different group of prealbumin ( tertile ) . when compare with subject in the high tertile , those in the low tertile be old , more likely to have diabetes medical history , with high Neutrophil count , low lymphocyte count , bad coagulation function and liver function . a total of @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient require mechanical ventilation , @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient admit to intensive care unit and @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient die during hospitalization . the incidence of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation be significantly decrease across prealbumin tertiles ( all-cause death , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 ; ICU admission , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 , mechanical ventilation , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 , respectively ) . To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome , we construct three model use univariate and multivariate logistic regression model ( table 2 ) . in the unadjusted model , the ORs of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation be significantly increase as the prealbumin tertiles downgrade . the OR for tertile 1 be significantly high than the OR for tertile 3 ( OR = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for all-cause death ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for ICU admission ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for mechanical ventilation ) . additional adjustment for the demographic variable and comorbidities do not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in-hospital outcome . further adjust for the baseline level of blood examination , include blood routine ( neutrophil , lymphocyte , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ) , coagulation function ( prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , d-dimer ) , liver fuction ( alanine transaminase , aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin ) , renal function ( blood urea nitrogen , creatinine ) and infection indicator ( C-reactive protein ) do not affect the relationship in the fully adjust model ( Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P =0.0006 for all-cause death ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P @card@ for ICU admission ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P = @card@ for mechanical ventilation ) . therefore , low tertile of prealbumin exhibit an increase risk of bad in-hospital outcome ( full adjusted P for trend for all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation : P < @card@ , P <0.0001 and P = @card@ respectively ) . generalize additive model ( Fig 2 A through 2C ) be use to visually assess functional relationship between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in-hospital outcome . Serum prealbumin be find to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation . To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in-hospital outcome , we conduct stratify analysis ( Table 3 ) . for each unit increase of prealbumin , the adjusted OR for all-cause death be @card@ in male ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ in female ( P = @card@ ) . the adjusted OR for all-cause death for person less than @card@ year of age be @card@ ( P = @card@ ) compare with @card@ ( p = @card@ ) for person @card@ year and old ( P interaction = @card@ ) . for each unit increase of the prealbumin , the OR for all-cause death be @card@ ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ ( P = @card@ ) for normotensives and hypertensive , @card@ ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ ( P = @card@ ) for non-diabetic and diabetes respectively . the difference of interaction be not significant between two group ( P interaction = @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ stratify for gender , age , hypertention and diabetes respectively ) . moreover , the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratify by gender , age , hypertention and diabetes be consistent . in this study , we find that low serum prealbumin significantly associate with an increase risk of bad outcome and all-cause death during hospitalization . patient in the low tertile of prealbumin be old , and with high Neutrophil count , low lymphocyte count , bad coagulation function and liver function compare with subject in the high tertile . then we adjust relevant covariates include age , sex , smoking status , comorbidities , neutrophil , lymphocyte , coagulation function , liver function , renal function and C-reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confound . compare with crude regression analysis , this association still persist when adjust for demographic and clinical variable in the multivariable regression analysis . moreover , stratify by gender , age , hypertension and diabetes , increase level of serum prealbumin be associate with the decrease risk of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation , which determine the consistency of the relationship between low serum prealbumin tertile and the increase risk of bad outcome in elderly COVID-19 patient . several previous study have demonstrate baseline prealbumin change in COVID-19 patient . decrease level of prealbumin be observe among COVID-19 patients10 . Wu C et al investigate @card@ patient with COVID-19 and observe that prealbumin be associate with the development of ARDS , indicate the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID-19 clinical ending11 . till date , no report exist on the effect of prealbumin in COVID-19 elderly patient . high proportion of severe to critical case and high fatality rate be observe in the elderly COVID-19 patient , and rapid disease progress be note in the dead5 . One possible explanation involve the great potential of senior to be in a state of inflammation , nutritional deficiency and other complication . Prealbumin be a globular , non-glycosilated protein , synthesize by the liver , and complexed with a retinol-binding protein , which act as a transporter of retinol/vitamin A and thyroid hormones7 . low plasma prealbumin level have far-back emerge as an early laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status12 , @card@ . in addition , prealbumin be also associate with inflammation . previous study show that in response to the inflammation , the body respond by synthesize a large number of cytokines . these include interleukins and tumor necrosis factor that down-regulate , decrease , plasma concentration of albumin and prealbumin14 , @card@ . therefore , assay of serum prealbumin concentration be recommend by some investigator as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation . elderly with low plasma prealbumin level mean that those people be at great risk of malnutrition and inflammatory condition , which may lead to poor prognosis . malnutrition be commonly see in hospitalize patient in both the developed and develop world , especially among elderly patient . a review of @card@ publish study of acute care patient report that malnutrition incidence range from 42–91 % of hospitalize elderly16 . it be find that compare to non-famine region of India , experience famine have significantly high influenza mortality rate during the @card@ Influenza pandemic17 . aging , frailty , and chronic disease be associate with impaired immune function and be compound by immune dysregulation from malnutrition . when immune response be dysregulated , it would result in an excessive inflammation , even death . in the current COVID-19 study , it be find that elderly patient have high level of white blood cell count , CRP , inflammatory cytokines and be more likely to experience critical disease than do those young patients4 , @card@ . this retrospective cohort study include @card@ elderly COVID-19 patient , until the date of February @card@ , @card@ , @card@ % of patient require mechanical ventilation , @card@ % of patient admit to intensive care unit , and the total in-hospital mortality be @card@ % . the mortality rate be low than that report by Wang L et al5 among elderly COVID-19 patient . this may have be the reason for some patient at the date of February @card@ , @card@ be still in hospital . nevertheless , this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome because of the definite observation time we set previously . moreover , Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the large third-grade class a hospital equip with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality . the result of this study have several clinical implication and strength . a low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regard primarily as a signal identify the at-risk elderly patient who would suffer bad outcome and require careful assessment and monitor for whom nutritional support and inflammation detection may be need as part of the treatment plan19 . as observational study be susceptible to various confounder , we adjust many variable that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome to minimize potential confound . in addition , we test the robustness of the result by repeat the analysis in different subgroup of gender , age , history of hypertension and history of diabetes . our study have some limitation . first , by include patient still in hospital as of J February @card@ , @card@ , the case fatality ratio in our study can reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID-19 . second , the record of datum may be affect by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset . third , since all subject in our study be hospitalize Chinese elderly patient diagnose with COVID-19 , result of this study might not directly be apply to other ethnicities and age group . in conclusion , this retrospective cohort study reveal that the prealbumin be an independent risk factor for the in-hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID-19 elderly patient . nutritional support and inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patient with low prealbumin concentration .

All the author confirm that there be no plagiarism or self-plagiarism and fabrication of datum .   erythema nodosum-like rash in a COVID-19 patient : a case report Erythema nodosum ( EN ) be a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be trigger by a variety of condition , include infection , drug , pregnancy , malignancy , and inflammatory process . while its pathophysiology be not fully elucidate , EN be most commonly associate with infection , particularly Streptococcus specie [ 6 ] . it occur in both sex and all age range , although more often in woman [ 6 ] . on exam , classic presentation involve the low extremity with patient present with tender , erythematous nodule on bilateral shin . nodule typically resolve on their own without intervention within eight week of onset [ 6 ] . the diagnosis of en be primarily clinical base on history and physical examination . laboratory study and skin biopsy may be consider in atypical presentation to confirm diagnosis . the condition typically resolve spontaneously and therefore treatment target symptom control [ 6 ] . Coronavirus @card@ ( COVID-19)is a novel virus think to infect cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor which can be find on multiple organ system , include skin.1 there have be multiple report of cutaneous manifestation of the disease range from pernio ( chilblain)-like lesion to urticarial rash [ 2 ] . below , the author discuss a case of COVID-19 trigger en . case presentation : a 54-year-old female with history of hypothyroidism and hypertension present to the Emergency Department with chief complaint of new rash develop over the last @card@ H. this erythematous , painful and pruritic rash be diffusely spread over the bilateral upper extremity , chest , neck , back , and face . the patient be confirm positive by nasopharyngeal Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) for COVID-19 @card@ h prior to rash onset . the patient 's review of system be unremarkable . the patient 's initial vital sign be blood pressure of @card@ mmHg , heart rate of @card@ beat per minute , respiratory rate of @card@ breath per minute , oxygen saturation of @card@ % on room air with a temperature of @card@ degree Fahrenheit . on exam the patient have erythematous , non-blanching , circular , raise , tender nodule locate on bilateral upper extremity , chest , back , neck , and face consistent with EN ( Fig 1 . , Fig . 2 , Fig . 3 ) . ulceration and weeping be not note on exam . the patient be discharge with strict return precaution and advise to quarantine per Center for Disease Control guideline . To reduce the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare worker , dermatology be not consult during the patient 's Emergency Department visit base on her clinically stable exam . she be prescribe naproxen and hydroxyzine for symptom control . with the continued rise in COVID-19 case globally , recognize the multitude of disease presentation be key in both treatment of individual and containment of viral spread . the true frequency of cutaneous manifestation be unknown but be estimate to be up to @card@ % of case [ 4 ] . there have be multiple case report and case series outline dermatologic manifestation of COVID-19 . the previously describe exanthems include vesicular , pernio ( chilblain)-like lesion , livedo reticularis , urticarial , petechial , and maculopapular [ @card@ , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ] . these viral exanthems have be describe to occur throughout various stage of the disease and do not correlate well with severity of illness [ 4 ] . while many case have report dermatologic symptom prior to respiratory symptom , the majority of study have suggest onset a few day after other symptom [ 2 ] . however , the above case describe a novel cutaneous presentation of COVID-19 as well as a unique presentation of en . this particular patient do not warrant hospitalization at the time of presentation , though further case outline the presentation of similar exanthems would be helpful in elucidate timing and severity of illness associate with EN-like eruption in COVID-19 . it be crucial for emergency physician to recognize the variety of COVID-19 manifestation , include dermatologic , to aid in early identification of this highly communicable world-wide disease . erythema nodosum be a self-limiting rash that have be implicate with many know trigger include infection , malignancy , and drug . its identification as possible dermatologic exanthema for COVID-19 be important for early identification , treatment , and quarantine of this disease . earlier identification and recognition of the virus by emergency physician will help improve outcome and mitigate transmission . presentation : none .

[ 7 ]   respond to disaster : form and function of a pharmacy incident command structure the PICS create a hierarchy of role and team contribute to pharmacy-specific incident response effort ( Figure 1 ) . the chief pharmacy officer serve as the incident commander and direct all activity of the PICS . the structure be divide into 6 sections—communications , employee safety , clinical , drug-use policy/formulary , operation , and logistic , each lead by a section chief . each section of the PICS contain multiple pharmacy action team , each of which be assign an action team lead . the pharmacy action team strategically align and integrate with those of the SIM-HICS . several pharmacy action team have a correlate SIM-HICS team , while other operate internally to meet pharmacy-specific need . for those with a correlate SIM-HICS team , pharmacy action team lead also participate as member of the SIM-HICS team and act as liaison between the PICS and SIM-HICS . Pharmacy director be appoint to section chief role by the incident commander and be responsible for provide leadership and oversight of all activity within their domain . pharmacy manager , supervisor , coordinator , and specialist serve as pharmacy action team lead . section chief and action team lead be appoint to position base on their current leadership role , subject matter expertise , and skill set . alternate leader be assign to the incident commander , section chief , and pharmacy action team lead role . they participate in the same capacity as the primary leader to ensure continuity of the PICS activity . Health-system pharmacy administration and leadership ( HSPAL ) resident and pharmacy administrative support staff be assign to project manager role for each PICS section . project manager be responsible for maintain update project plan , prioritizing action team task , and assist with administrative task , such as schedule virtual team meeting . pharmacy specialist , resident , and technician participate in the PICS as pharmacy action team member , play a critical role in decision-making process and plan execution . the corporate structure of the YNHH pharmacy enterprise create a unique opportunity to establish the PICS . the need for accountability , clear communication , manageable leader expectation , and integration among system pharmacy team lead to its inception . principle of the HICS be utilize to create the PICS and ensure alignment of pharmacy response effort to those of the SIM-HICS . the HICS establish role for a complete hospital incident management team and identify 5 primary management section ( Ie , command , operation , planning , logistic , and finance/administration\n",
            ") , each of which have additional associated branch or teams.2 follow an internal assessment , modification be make to the HICS section to optimize the structure for pharmacy use and COVID-19–related challenge . Three unique sections—communications , employee safety , and drug-use policy/formulary—were incorporate into the PICS . addition of the communication section be drive by the need to frequently communicate both internally to a large pharmacy team and externally to various stakeholder across the healthcare system . the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on team member drive the formation of the employee safety section . with adequate medication supply be a top priority of the health system , the drug-use policy/formulary section be strategically incorporate into the PICS to leverage pharmacy expertise . additionally , the planning and finance/administration section of the HICS be collapse in the PICS , and related responsibility be reassign to other PICS section . a timeline of the PICS development and activity during the first several month of the COVID-19 pandemic be represent in Figure 2 . planning and assessment . COVID-19 response planning be facilitate by conduct virtual scenario planning session and utilize a health-system pharmacy department–specific assessment tool . the scenario planning session be conduct to assess potential extreme . Twelve scenario be assess , include infusion center change and support , staff shortage , new patient location ( internal and external ) , patient census surge , vulnerable ambulatory population , sterile compounding change ( to decant or plan to insource ) , severe drug shortages/outages , personal protective equipment shortage , staff burnout , education and training need , communication and coordination , and financial impact . the goal of this exercise be to prepare the PICS for worst-case scenario . each planning session utilize the HICS incident action plan ( IAP ) form to document potential challenge , solution , and resource needs.6 the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists ( ASHP ) COVID-19 pandemic assessment tool for health-system pharmacy department be utilize to identify gap in readiness across the pharmacy enterprise . the 6 category in the tool , include integration with institutional planning , departmental leadership , public and professional education and training , medication and supply , staffing , and public affairs/communications , be assess for vulnerabilities.7 Communication and collaboration be critical to project plan execution ; thus , a dedicated space be create on the pharmacy collaboration website to house project plan and related material . finding from the scenario planning session and assessment be translate into specific objective , strategy , and tactic before be incorporate into a pharmacy action team project plan . all pharmacy action team utilize a standardized project plan template to facilitate timely project execution and reporting . do and colleagues5 recently publish additional detail on the template , include example item from the PICS ambulatory care action team project plan . Pharmacy action team lead meet with their respective team member and project manager to review progress and update the project plan . meeting frequency vary base on individual team need but range from twice-weekly to daily occurrence with additional work meeting as require . section chief regularly meet with their action team lead and project manager to obtain a report on project plan status and provide team with direction . the health system’s proximity to New York City , an early epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak , contribute to rapid increase in patient census . in response , @card@ bed be add , increase the system’s total inpatient capacity to @card@ bed . participant of the PICS often work around the clock , devote most hour to PICS activity to ensure adequate pharmacy support for new bed and increase patient volume . team be require to practice flexibility , replace traditionally perfect execution with be comfortable with “ good enough , ” as quick decision and action be need . the incident commander , section chief , and project manager convene daily to evaluate project plan status , highlight successful strategy completion , and discuss potential barrier . newly identify strategy be assign to pharmacy action team project plan at this time to avoid duplicate assignment between group . action team lead be occasionally invite to this meeting to report on critical initiative and receive guidance . the content of internal and external communication be review daily by the incident commander and section chief . the unique communication strategy utilize by the PICS have be describe previously.4 the incident commander participate in a daily SIM-HICS report-out with other senior health-system executive . during this time , the incident commander utilize information recently report by PICS section chief to share status update on hot topic item , such as drug supply . integration with the SIM-HICS at this level allow for collaboration across discipline and increase access to invaluable system resource . for example , when sharing challenge relate to drug supply monitoring , this integration allow for a quick connection with the Office of Strategy Management ( OSM ) . member of the PICS supply chain action team be then able to collaborate with the OSM , who help build robust reporting tool that allow for precise monitoring of the health system’s supply of critical drug . Pulk and colleagues4 have previously describe the method utilize to leverage big datum to support drug procurement effort . as the COVID-19 patient census begin to wane and the health system begin recovery effort , it become apparent that the system would not revert to “ normal ” practice but would instead define a new normal . the acknowledgment of this transformation lead to renewed PICS initiative that aim to leverage efficiency gain during the emergency response , build upon enhanced communication and collaboration , and inspire the adoption of technology to transform our way of do business . a virtual pharmacy leadership retreat be hold over 2 day focus on identify recovery and transformation strategy with the theme “ be bold enough to leave the past behind . ” Pharmacy leader , include the PICS incident commander , section chief , and action team lead , participate in the retreat . Pharmacy action team be instruct to evaluate exist response-phase project plan in term of the category “ start , ” “ stop , ” or “ continue , ” to brainstorm new objective , and to identify resource need for COVID-19 recovery effort . leader also participate in virtual breakout session to discuss prompt transformational topic such as turbocharging decision-making , envision sustained remote work , and accelerate actionable analytics . at least one individual with expertise relevant to the subject matter be assign to each group . during the retreat , feedback from PICS participant be gather via a survey that assess pharmacy effort during the emergency response and change need to streamline the PICS for recovery and transformation . overall , participant agree on a reduce frequency for report-out and team meeting . additionally , many action team lead request more involvement in meeting with the incident commander and section chief . One significant change to action team structure that result from this survey involve combine the pharmacy automation , information technology , and facilities/equipment action team . Response-phase project plan assessment and breakout session finding from the leadership retreat lead to modify both PICS project plan and the pharmacy multiyear strategic plan . the incident commander , section chief , and project manager review the “ start , ” “ stop , ” or “ continue ” category assign to each PICS response-phase project plan strategy . the remain item result in recovery-phase action team project plan . finding from the transformation breakout session be translate into actionable objective , strategy , and tactic before be incorporate into the strategic plan . the incident commander and section chief alter the PICS to streamline recovery-phase action team project plan , align with health-system recovery effort , and incorporate participant feedback . overall , recovery-phase initiative continue to be execute and monitor similarly to the previous response-phase effort . in alignment with the SIM-HICS , the PICS incident commander’s meeting with section chief be reduce to twice weekly . action team lead be invite to this meeting once weekly to provide reporting . the execution and monitoring of transformation initiative include in the pharmacy strategic plan follow prepandemic process . the pharmacy strategic planning committee utilize strategic planning execution software to assign project and provide define objective . leader responsible for project oversight input datum and provide progress update monthly for review . the development of the PICS structure have several advantage that support team function , reach , and agility . engagement and integration with the SIM-HICS be pivotal to efficient communication with stakeholder . centralized documentation create a collaboration platform for sharing , planning , and access information for quick decision-making . project manager be essential for maintain update documentation , coordinate meeting time , and prioritizing activity . To proficiently navigate the COVID-19 pandemic , engagement of both leadership and frontline staff be critical . the PICS enable us to reinvent the pharmacy enterprise’s governance structure , focus on the pandemic’s immediate demand , expedite decision-making process , and execute plan while maintain the flexibility to pivot base on ever-changing information . the structure allow us to create coordinate system communication , assess and redeploy staff base on demand , and establish a process for daily consensus update to drug-use policy guideline . additionally , integration of the PICS with pertinent SIM-HICS team afford the ability to pool resource , release capital allocation , and document support for governmental stimulus and assistance . the precipitous nature of the COVID-19 pandemic test the will of both pharmacy leader and frontline staff . the success of the YNHH pharmacy enterprise be the result of coordinate , collaborative , and unprecedented effort .   myocarditis and pericarditis follow COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination : practical consideration for Care Providers ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine have identify potential adverse event post-vaccination . recently , datum present to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) report on incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after ∼300,000,000 COVID-19 mRNA dose in the United States . case be much more common follow the second dose , with a preponderance of male affect ( approximately @card@ time more frequent than in female ) . similar to previous report of myocarditis/pericarditis with other vaccine , one suspect that there be likely under-reporting of the true incidence base on subclinical disease . through June 5 , @card@ , an incidence of @card@ case per million second dose in the @card@ year-old age group be observe in the @card@ day follow vaccination , with cluster within the first 6 days.1 Surveillance datum in Canada ( up to July 9 , @card@ ) include @card@ case of myocarditis/pericarditis , where case have be see after 1st and 2nd dose of vaccine , and between 5 hour and @card@ day post exposure.2 these clinical finding be similar to multiple series report worldwide . the reference for these case series can be find in the online supplement . To date , myopericarditis have be report to occur follow both available mRNA vaccine ( Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech ) . standardized case definition be important to understand the true incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination . this pose a number of challenge : the who Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety ( GACVS ) utilize the Brighton Collaboration case definition for myocarditis , which discriminate five level of certainty for the diagnosis . by comparison , the Vaccine adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) in the United States draw from historic case definition for myocarditis , categorize event as suspected , probable or confirm – the latter specifically require the presence of pathognomonic histological finding of myocardial inflammation to be present at biopsy or autopsy . in VAERS , event may be self-reported and adjudication be challenge in the absence of medical record review and confirmatory diagnostic testing . finally , and most relevant to the practitioner , myocarditis and pericarditis diagnostic criterion for the purpose of direct patient care may be different from those use by surveillance system to classify a report event with respect to certainty of diagnosis . in this regard , the CDC working case definition for myocarditis , which categorize case as probable or confirm , good align with our understanding of how myocarditis be currently worked-up in Canada ( a summary of the case definition and reference can be find online , Supplementary Table S1 ) . adverse event follow immunization should be report to the Public Health authority , which in most province and territory be the local Medical Officer of Health ( ttps : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/federal-provincial-territorial-contact-information-aefi-related-questions . html . ) this be important for detection of potential safety signal as well as future immunization recommendation for the individual recipient . Healthcare provider should report any serious or unusual event suspect to be associate with vaccination . definitive proof of a causal association be not necessary , and for many event , can be obtain ; however , event with a clear alternate explanation should not be report . Myocarditis/pericarditis be not a listed adverse event on the current reporting form in most jurisdiction as these be base on the national form ( https : //www . Canada . ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/aefi-form-july23-2020-eng . pdf ) , but should be report as ‘ other event – other serious or unexpected event not list on the form ' . all Canadian province and territory report into the Canadian adverse event follow Immunization Surveillance System ( CAEFISS ) , the national system for detection of serious and rare event that generate estimate of incidence ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss . html ) . CAEFISS have issue weekly summary of report adverse event with a focus on serious event and adverse event of special interest . this process also inform Health Canada , the vaccine regulatory authority , with responsibility for initial authorization of product for use and periodic update to the product monograph include safety finding . such update have be make several time since initial emergency use authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine , initially for the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and capillary leak syndrome , and most recently for the mRNA vaccine with myocarditis/pericarditis . clinician can remain current with such safety signal through subscribe to the MedEffect Canada system ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada . html . ) patient with suspected myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination do not usually require extensive evaluation if symptom be mild . Myocarditis/pericarditis should be suspect in patient present with symptom of chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitation , syncope , diaphoresis , or fatigue without obvious cause , which be also associate with evidence of myocardial injury by elevation in cardiac biomarkers ( i. e. a serum troponin level ) . Serum troponin elevation in myocarditis be often significant ( >10x upper limit of normal ) in patient with myocarditis . ECG change be common and include ST elevation in multiple lead , non-specific ST/T change , and diffuse T wave inversion . the differential diagnosis remain broad and include infectious cause ( viral , bacterial , fungal ) , include acute COVID-19 infection , or post-COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children/Adults ( MIS-C/MIS-A ) , drug and toxin , systemic autoimmune disease , or specific etiology such as sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis . due diligence must be maintain to rule out other cause depend on the clinical presentation ; myocardial ischemia due to coronary disease may also need to be consider in young person with suspicious symptom . suggest evaluation of a patient with high pre-test probability of myocarditis/pericarditis should follow a rational clinical approach ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . careful history and physical examination be indicate for all patient with careful attention to timing of and type of antecedent vaccination . the majority of report suggest typical onset of myocarditis/pericarditis symptom occur within 5 day follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccine exposure . initial evaluation should include an ECG and laboratory test : CBC , electrolyte , renal function , live function test , CRP and troponin , and COVID-19 PCR testing . clinically significant myocarditis be unlikely in the setting of a normal ECG and cardiac biomarkers . normal troponin and a normal ECG on presentation do not exclude isolated pericarditis . treatment should be start if there be a high index of suspicion . the need for more extensive cardiac imaging and additional testing will depend upon the result of the screening test as list above . Echocardiography should be perform in case compatible with myocarditis/pericarditis , especially in the setting of an elevated troponin ( in the absence of an alternative explanation ) . cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may be consider where available and where impact on management can reasonably be expect ( i. e. where echocardiography be normal with elevated troponin , yet clinical suspicion remain high ) . coronary artery imaging should be consider in appropriate case to rule out myocardial infarction as a cause of biomarker/ECG abnormality . an assessment flow diagram can be see in the online Supplementary Figure S1 . there be no clear evidence to support the use of anti-inflammatory therapy for all patient with myocarditis/pericarditis . spontaneous resolution of symptom be reportedly prevalent . overall , the therapeutic approach for symptomatic patient may include pain management and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with or without colchicine ( the latter suggest particularly when pericarditis be the predominant presentation ) . use of intravenous immune-globulins ( IVIG ) , corticosteroid , and biologic immune-modulating agent have be report , and may be consider in severe case . for rare case of hemodynamic instability require inotropic support , patient should be manage at tertiary care centre with capacity for manage cardiogenic shock and critically ill cardiac patient . supportive measure may include inotropic/vasoactive drug , anti-thrombotic therapy , mechanical ventilation , or mechanical circulatory support include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . for patient recover from significant illness , follow-up should be coordinate in consultation with a cardiovascular specialist to provide guidance on further imaging/evaluation , treatment , and return to regular activity as strenuous exercise should be avoid until follow-up assessment . recommendation regard further COVID-19 mRNA vaccination for those with confirmed myocarditis/pericarditis will evolve as evidence emerge . in the near term , it may be prudent to defer or delay the 2nd or subsequent vaccine dose in accordance with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization ( NACI ) guidance.3 consideration of risk with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination have to be balance against the risk of complication from COVID-19 infection . propose mechanism of cardiac involvement in those infected with COVID-19 include sympathetic stimulation , pro-inflammatory effect , myocyte necrosis lead to myocarditis , and heightened risk of arrhythmia and leave ventricular dysfunction . in addition , the hypercoagulable state associate with COVID-19 infection , along with direct vascular infection and concomitant cellular inflammation , contribute to high risk of myocardial infarction . multiple study have report prevalence of cardiac complication in adult after COVID-19 infection , which include heart failure ( @card@ % ) , myocardial injury/myocarditis ( @card@ % ) , arrhythmia ( @card@ % ) and thromboembolism ( @card@ % ) . in those that develop myocarditis with elevated inflammatory biomarkers ( leukocytosis , lymphopenia , d-dimer , c-reactive protein and pro-calcitonin ) and elevated troponin level , high mortality rate ( @card@ % - @card@ % ) have be describe in several case series.4 in contrast to adult , child have be largely spare COVID-19 related acute pulmonary infection and associated complication . however , child be vulnerable to a post-exposure hyperinflammatory syndrome know as MIS-C . this syndrome can result in a severe clinical course require intensive care management . cardiovascular complication from MIS-C include cardiac dysfunction ( @card@ % ) , shock ( @card@ % ) , pericardial effusion ( @card@ % ) , mitral regurgitation ( @card@ % ) , myocarditis ( @card@ % ) , heart failure ( @card@ % ) , and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm ( @card@ % ) , with a mortality rate of @card@ in light of current knowledge , it be reasonable to consider that despite the rarity of potential adverse outcome follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis/pericarditis in both adult and child , the benefit from the vaccine in avoid COVID-19 infection and its related complication outweigh the risk . base on the current state of knowledge regard the potential association between mRNA vaccination and myocarditis/pericarditis , “ take away message ” for cardiovascular care provider can be articulate . these include : • the estimated incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccination across different age group be likely to change with additional datum ; at present this be a rare event , with most report suggest incidence of 1 case per @card@ vaccination . • the majority of myocarditis/pericarditis case have be report follow a second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination , with great incidence in male . presentation be usually early ( within the first week ) follow vaccination . • the majority of myocarditis/pericarditis case report have be mild and self-limited . severe case present as more fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock be exceedingly rare and likely merit more extensive investigation to exclude other cause . • the approach to investigation should be tailor to the clinical presentation . suspected case require a careful history and physical exam , ECG , routine laboratory work and consideration for echocardiography . patient with significant symptom and routine testing supportive of a diagnosis of myocarditis/pericarditis should undergo additional cardiac investigation with specialized testing base on availability and likelihood of an impact on clinical management . • suspected case should be report to the Public Health adverse event follow Immunization Reporting System ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/reporting-adverse-events-following-immunization . html ) by the health care provider of record . • no specific therapy can be recommend at present and care be largely supportive . a cardiac care provider should assess patient who require admission to hospital to provide guidance on monitoring , further management and post-discharge follow-up instruction . • COVID-19 mRNA vaccination be recommend in all population for which a benefit have be establish , in accordance with Health Canada and NACI guideline . base on our current knowledge , the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination in all age group far outweigh the potential risk of mRNA vaccination and that of possible COVID-19 infection in susceptible individual . • for patient with myocarditis/pericarditis temporally associate with the 1st dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination , available evidence be currently insufficient to support any clinical practice recommendation . question remain as to whether these patient should avoid a second vaccination , have further delay between dose , or have a non-mRNA vaccine as a second dose . ○As a precaution , and in accordance with NACI recommendation , patient with established myocarditis/pericarditis follow first mRNA vaccination should defer a second dose indefinitely pend additional datum . base on our current state of knowledge , the association between myocarditis/pericarditis and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in child and young adult merit careful consideration for practitioner . case tend to be mild , do not usually require specific intervention , and potential risk of the vaccine be outweigh by the well-defined risk of COVID-19 infection . vaccination continue to be recommend in all eligible individual . a thoughtful approach to evaluation , management and report of suspected case of myocarditis/pericarditis be indicate as a key public health measure . none no source of funding be obtain for this work   Factors Associated with racial difference in Deaths among Nursing Home Residents with COVID-19 Infection in the US Deaths associate with coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) infection in the US have be disproportionately high among individual from racial and ethnic minority group compare with White individuals.1 give that @card@ % of COVID-19 death have be associate with long-term care facilities,2 it be not surprising that the disparity observe among individual with COVID-19 in the general population be also present among nurse home resident with COVID-19.3 in this study , we investigate the difference in COVID-19 case and death by the racial composition of nurse home resident and examine the factor associate with the high rate of COVID-19 death find in nurse home with the large proportion of resident from racial and ethnic minority group . before the COVID-19 pandemic begin , it be well establish that racial disparity in the quality of nurse home care be common.4 relative to White individual , Black individual be more likely to be admit to the lowest-quality nursing homes,5 which have low nurse staffing ratio , more serious regulatory deficiency , and a high likelihood of be terminate from the Medicaid program.6,7,8 disparity in care appear to be largely a function of where people go for care rather than differential treatment by staff member within the same facility , as nursing home be highly segregated.8 these disparity have also be associate with payment source . nursing home be primarily fund by public payer , with approximately two-third of resident in a typical facility cover by Medicaid insurance , and the proportion of resident with Medicaid coverage at the facility level have be associate with between-facility ( but not within-facility ) difference in quality , broadly defined.7 disparity in COVID-19 death may be expect give these difference in nurse home quality , but research to date have reveal little association between nurse home quality rating and COVID-19 case and deaths.9,10,11 Nursing home with high proportion of non-white resident may be especially susceptible to COVID-19 death for several additional reason that be more specific to the nature of the pandemic.12 First , non-white resident be more likely to live in facility that be large , which create more opportunity for viral transmission . second , non-white resident generally enter nursing home in bad health,13 which may be associate with high COVID-19 mortality . third , non-white resident be more likely to live in facility that be for profit , more reliant on Medicaid , and have deficiency in care.7,14,15 fourth , COVID-19 be more prevalent in non-white community , and community spread be a factor associate with case and death in nurse homes.10,11 our goal in this study be to investigate the racial factor associate with COVID-19 death among nurse home resident by examine the association between the racial composition of nurse home resident and COVID-19 death and assess whether that association be attenuate when facility size , case mix , other facility characteristic , and community prevalence of COVID-19 be take into account . the primary outcome be facility-level count of COVID-19 death among nurse home resident as self-reported by nurse home begin between January 1 , @card@ , and May @card@ , @card@ , and end on September @card@ , @card@ . we also examine the total number of confirm and suspect COVID-19 case among resident over the same period . confirmed case be define as COVID-19 infection confirm by a diagnostic laboratory test . suspected case be define as sign and/or symptom of COVID-19 infection or patient-specific transmission-based precaution for COVID-19 infection . we calculate the number of facility-level death per @card@ case from these 2 measure . nursing home racial composition be measure as the proportion of resident of non-Hispanic White race contain in the LTCfocus database , group into 5 racial composition quintile across the sample . quintile category be base on the percentage of nurse home resident who be White ( quintile 1 indicate 0 % to @card@ % , quintile 2 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , quintile 3 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , quintile 4 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , and quintile 5 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % ) . the proportion of White resident be derive from self-reported datum provide by nurse home resident as part of Minimum Data Set assessment . the available datum do not allow us to examine all non-white group separately . however , to assess possible difference among group that we could identify , we use an alternative categorization of nurse home in supplemental analysis , classify home as have high proportion of White , Black , Hispanic or Hispanic and Black resident by use the percentage of resident in each of the 3 race/ethnicity category available in the LTCfocus database . case mix be measure use the LTCfocus acuity index and the proportion of resident with hypertension . the acuity index capture functional limitation and cognitive impairment among a facility’s resident . acuity index score be calculate by LTCfocus at the facility level , and score range from 0 to @card@ , with 0 indicate no functional or cognitive impairment among any of the resident and @card@ indicate severe limitation and the need for several specialized service among all resident . in the nursing home include in this study , acuity index score range from 0 to @card@ . we control for nurse home characteristic that be report to be associate with COVID-19 death in previous studies10,11 ; these characteristic include the number of certified bed ( which be use as a proxy for facility size ) , nurse home ownership ( for-profit , government , or nonprofit ) , chain membership , payer mix ( Medicaid and Medicare ) , Nursing Home Compare overall star rating ( range , @card@ star , with 1 star indicate low quality and 5 star indicate high quality ) , and case mix–adjusted nursing hour ( measure as hour per resident per day ) . community spread be measure as the number of confirmed COVID-19 case ( exclude case among nurse home resident ) per @card@ people in the county . first , we compute unadjusted mean to describe the characteristic of nurse home by racial composition quintile . next , we use multivariable regression model to estimate the marginal effect of quintile for the number of death , sequentially add adjustment for number of bed , case mix , other facility characteristic , and county-level COVID-19 case . because the number of death be a count outcome that include a large number of facility report 0 death , we use zero-inflated negative binomial models.17 we also repeat the main analysis use negative binomial model to determine the extent to which the finding be sensitive to the specific count datum model use ( eTable 3 in the supplement ) . To aid the interpretation of the regression analysis result , we report average marginal effect estimate and sis for each quintile relative to the base category of quintile 5 , which represent the group of nurse home with the high proportion of White resident . we also use stratification , divide the sample into 5 group base on the nursing home ' overall star rating from the Nursing Home Compare archives to examine whether association observe in the full sample be different for nurse home with different rating . Stata software , version @card@ ( StataCorp LLC ) be use for all analysis . statistical test be 2-sided with a significance threshold of P < @card@ . datum be analyze from July @card@ to December @card@ , @card@ . among @card@ @card@ nursing home include in the study , the mean ( SD ) age of resident be @card@ ( @card@ ) year , and @card@ % be female . as of September @card@ , @card@ , @card@ @card@ COVID-19 case and @card@ @card@ COVID-19–associated death be report among resident , with a mean ( SD ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) death per facility . a total of @card@ @card@ nursing home ( @card@ % ) report at least 1 COVID-19 case , and @card@ nursing home ( @card@ % ) report at least 1 COVID-19–associated death . the mean ( SD ) proportion of White resident be @card@ % ( @card@ % ) , range from less than @card@ % in quintile 1 facility to more than @card@ % in quintile 5 facility ( Table 1 ) . the mean ( SD ) number of death in nurse home with the high proportion of non-white resident ( quintile 1 ) vs nursing home with the high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) and @card@ ( @card@ ) , respectively . compare with nurse home with high proportion of non-white resident ( quintile 1 ) , nurse home with high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be locate in county with few confirmed COVID-19 case per capita ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] case per @card@ people vs @card@ [ @card@ ] case per @card@ people ) , be less likely to be for profit ( @card@ facility [ @card@ % ] vs @card@ facility [ @card@ % ] ) , and have few certified bed ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] bed vs @card@ [ @card@ ] bed ) , good resident health as measure by the acuity index ( mean [ SD ] score , @card@ [ @card@ ] vs @card@ [ @card@ ] ) and the percentage of resident with hypertension ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , a low proportion of resident with Medicaid coverage ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , a high proportion of resident with Medicare coverage ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , high star rating ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] star vs @card@ [ @card@ ] star ) , and high nursing hour ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] hour per resident per day vs @card@ [ @card@ ] hour per resident per day ) ( Table 1 ) . the number of COVID-19 case and death decrease monotonically with the percentage of White resident ( Figure 1 ) . the mean ( SD ) number of case among nurse home with the high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) , while the mean ( SD ) number of case among nurse home with the low proportion of White resident ( quintile 1 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) ( Table 1 ) . facility in quintile 1 experience a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than those in quintile 5 , represent a 3.3-fold high number of death in quintile 1 compare with the mean ( SD ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) death among facility in quintile 5 . the mean ( SD ) number of facility-level death per @card@ case be @card@ ( @card@ ) among facility in quintile 1 , which be 2-fold high than the mean ( SD ) number of @card@ ( @card@ ) death per @card@ case among facility in quintile 5 ( Table 1 ) . these unadjusted difference in death count by nursing home racial composition decrease when sequentially adjust for characteristic that differ across the nursing home quintile group . after adjustment for the number of certified bed in a facility , nurse home in quintile 1 be associate with a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than facility in quintile 5 ( figure 2 ; eTable 2 in the supplement ) . adjust for case mix and additional nurse home characteristic do not modify this association . an analysis adjust for county-level COVID-19 case indicate further reduction in the difference between racial group ; however , even in the fully adjust model , nurse home with the high proportion of non-white resident have a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) additional COVID-19 death compare with nurse home with the low proportion of non-white resident . nursing home with more certified bed ( marginal effect [ SE ] of a 1-unit increase in the natural log of the number of certified bed , @card@ [ @card@ ] death ) , large proportion of resident with hypertension ( marginal effect [ Se ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] ) , few resident with Medicare coverage ( marginal effect [ Se ] , −0.013 [ @card@ ] ) , and few hour of nursing care ( marginal effect [ Se ] , −0.549 [ @card@ ] ) have more COVID-19–associated death ( eTable 3 in the supplement ) . these association be largely consistent within each of the Nursing Home Compare star rating category in the stratify analysis ( Table 2 ) . however , the difference in death count by racial composition be large among 1-star ( lowest-quality ) facility . for example , among 1-star facility , nurse home in quintile 1 have a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than those in quintile 5 , which represent the large marginal effect for quintile 1 of any of the star-rating category . the marginal effect of adjusted nursing hour per resident per day be only statistically significant for nurse home with 4 or 5 star and not those with low star rating . in the secondary analysis , we examine whether these association be different when nursing home be classify as have high proportion of Black or Hispanic resident . the unadjusted number of case and death be highest among nurse home with the high proportion of Black and Hispanic resident ( eFigure 1 in the supplement ) . in addition , as observe in the classification by percentage of White resident only , the difference be moderate by control for the number of certified bed and county-level case but not by control for case mix or other nurse home characteristic ( eFigure 2 in the supplement ) . result be also similar in an analysis use only confirm case ( eFigure 3 in the supplement ) and case among staff ( eFigure 4 in the supplement ) . the association between nurse home racial composition and death be consistent when examine datum from early in the pandemic ( May to June @card@ ) vs later in the pandemic ( July to September @card@ ) ( eTable 4 , eTable 5 , and eFigure 5 in the supplement ) . the number of facility-level death per @card@ case decrease over time ; however , the association between a high proportion of White resident and a low number of death per @card@ case be consistent in both of the period examine ( eTable 6 in the supplement ) . this study have several limitation . first , although facility-level characteristic be important , the current study be limit by the lack of individual-level datum on COVID-19 case and death among nurse home resident to study these disparity more explicitly . Individual-level datum be need to understand whether there be within-facility disparity in addition to the between-facility disparity identify in this study . more generally , future research use individual-level datum on COVID-19 case and death among nurse home resident be warrant to well understand the individual-level risk factor associate with bad COVID-19 outcome , include mortality , among this disproportionally impact population . second , our datum do not allow for racial classification other than White , Black , and Hispanic . more detailed datum on race and ethnicity be need to examine whether there be difference in COVID-19 outcome among the diverse non-white group . third , COVID-19 case and death count be self-reported , and nursing home be only require to report these count begin in mid-May @card@ , which omit many previous case and death from our analysis . fourth , our case mix variable may not capture all relevant aspect of health . Fifth , this study be a cross-sectional observational analysis that may not represent causal association . consistent with historical racial disparity in long-term care and current pandemic-associated death , this study’s result suggest that nursing home with high proportion of non-white resident be experience the bad COVID-19 outcome . disparity in death by nursing home racial composition be associate with the disproportionately high spread of the disease in non-white community and the characteristic of the nursing home that serve those community .   predictor of readmission require hospitalization after discharge from emergency department in patient with COVID-19 in December @card@ , an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) , occur in China , and , thereafter , it have dramatically spread worldwide [ @card@ ] . Italy be the first western country experience the unexpected , devastating impact of this pandemic , with an outstanding number of infected patient admit to emergency department ( editor ) in a relatively small amount of time . due to the high pressure to healthcare system over those week , some of them , deem as less severe , be discharge home [ 3 ] . although several study have report readmission rate after hospitalization and relative predictor , little be not know on prevalence of early hospital return of patient non-hospitalized [ [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . the aim of this study be to describe short-term return hospital admission ( within @card@ day ) of patient with mild and moderate COVID-19 discharge from two major ed within the Marche region ( an Italian region of @card@ million of inhabitant ) during the first wave , and to identify predictor of return hospital admission . we conduct a retrospective cohort study of adult patient with COVID-19 discharge from the two EDs of major hospital of the Marche Region ( “ Ospedali Riuniti ” Ancona , the coordinator centre ; “ Marche Nord ” Hospital , Pesaro , Italy ) from March 1 to April @card@ , @card@ . this date range be base on volume . the annual census be approximately @card@ and @card@ respectively in Ancona 's Ed and Pesaro 's editor . the whole inpatient capacity for COVID patient be @card@ . the decision to obtain imaging , and/or discharge be determine by the attend physician at his/her discretion . a specific hospital algorithm be not available . Anonymized datum of patient be collect from electronic medical record . patient be include in the study cohort if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal swab specimen within 7 day before or after the ED encounter [ 8 ] and be discharge from editor . we collect for all case : i ) demographic factor : sex , age , duration of symptom before ED visit ; ii ) comorbidities : hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia , cognitive impairment ( determine by the review of the anamnesis ) and other ; iii ) risk factor : being resident in care facility , fever , tachycardia , pulse oximetry on room air ( SatHb ≤94 % vs > @card@ % ) , PaO2/FiO2 ( P/F  @card@ mmHg or vs not available ) , pro-calcitonin , chest radiograph ( abnormal vs normal or vs not perform ) , age > @card@ year , neutrophilia , lactate dehydrogenase >100 U/L , C-reactive protein >3 mg/L and D-dimer >1000 μg/mL , the last five know to be associate with a poor prognosis [ @card@ ] . return hospital admission be define as an unscheduled return editor visit require hospitalization within @card@ days. we compare the group of patient who have a return hospital admission vs the group of patient who have not . the latter group include both patient who have not unscheduled return editor visit and those who have unscheduled return editor visit within @card@ day , but be then discharge again . descriptive statistic be use to summarize covariates and unadjusted outcome . continuous variable be assess with the unpaired Welch 's t-test if normally distribute and the Mann Whitney U test if not , use NCSS v20.0.2 . a p value <0.05 be consider statistically significant . during the study period , there be @card@ patient attend the two EDs and @card@ patient test positive for SARS-CoV-2 with an admission percentage of @card@ % . a total of @card@ subject be discharge and include in the present study . overall , the mean age be @card@ year ( range 18–95 year ) , there be a slight predominance of male gender ( @card@ % ) and the median duration of symptom be 9 day ( range 1–25 day ) . Sixty-five patient ( @card@ % ) have an unscheduled return editor visit within @card@ day , with the majority of whom ( @card@ % ) within @card@ days. of these , @card@ patient ( @card@ % [ @card@ % CI 9–17 ] ) be then hospitalize ( define a return hospital admission ) , while the remaining @card@ be again discharge . demographic and clinical characteristic at baseline ( i. e. on first hospital admission ) , for all patient and accord to the need of return hospital admission , be summarize in Table 1 . patient require a return hospital admission be significantly old ( @card@ year [ @card@ % CI 53.77–57.51 ] vs @card@ [ @card@ % CI 62.97–73.20 ] year , p < @card@ ) , have high pro-calcitonin ( @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.04–0.18 ] vs. @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.03–0.10 ] ng/mL , p < @card@ ) and D-dimer level ( @card@ [ @card@ % CI 445–2074 ] vs. @card@ [ @card@ % CI 529–730 ] μg/mL , p < @card@ ) . major predictor of return hospital admission be cognitive impairment ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 4.7–63.2 ] , p < @card@ ) , P/F  @card@ mmHg have low odd ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.1–0.5 ] , p = @card@ ) of return hospital admission compare to the group with hypoxia , as well as those with no comorbidities ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.1–0.7 ] , p = @card@ ) compare to those with almost one comorbidity ( Table 1 ) . To our knowledge , this be the first study assess prevalence and predictor of return hospital admission of patient with COVID-19 follow an initial editor discharge in Italy during the first wave . the prevalence be @card@ % , approximately two-time high than those report in three previous non- European cohort [ [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . however , in two of these study , readmission rate be assess within the first @card@ h from ED discharge . in the study by Kilaru et al . [ 5 ] , indeed , the rate of readmission increase to @card@ % when record at 7 days. Older age ( ≥ @card@ year ) , cognitive impairment , residence in geriatric care facility , comorbidities , hypoxia and neutrophilia be associate with a high probability of subsequent return hospital admission . age-related condition , in particular presence of dementia , seem to play a relevant role , likely due to the challenging assessment of initial clinical impairment as well as to the difficulty relate with management and monitoring of these patient , even in dedicated setting . in addition , our finding about neutrophilia and consequent lymphopenia corroborate datum suggest an association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and disease severity [ @card@ ] . of note , the presence of hypoxia at arterial blood gas analysis be a significant predictor of return hospital admission , while have a saturation ≤ @card@ % be not , underline the importance of a proper gas analysis assessment for a more precise risk stratification . not perform a arterial blood gas analysis be , indeed , significantly associate with a high risk of return hospital admission . on the other hand , it would be reasonable to speculate that a patient who be well enough to not require a blood gas analysis , would not have expect to return to hospital . in time of significant pressure to healthcare system , it may not be feasible to admit all patient at first presentation , even when they present with not negligible clinical feature . therefore , it be crucial to safely discharge subject with low risk for readmission , in order to prioritize bed availability . in this context , identify major predictor for return hospital admission might be a useful tool to develop and validate an algorithm for risk stratification [ [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . this study have several limitation . first , the small sample size of this study be a limitation . second , the limited representativeness of datum , that come from two ed only , as indication to admission and discharge might be different accord to hospital , be influence by internal guideline and the entity of pressure to health system . moreover , we could miss a number of return hospital admission , because some patient could subsequently go to other hospital or die at home . however , it be unlikely that patient go elsewhere because there be no other hospital in nearby radius . a further limitation be that we do not include the full range of potential risk factor as covariates associate with readmission , such as obesity or discharge medication . lastly , due to the retrospective nature of the study , more detailed datum on comorbidities or treatment prescribe at home be not available . in conclusion , we find that approximately @card@ % of patient with COVID-19 , initially discharge from the editor , return for an unscheduled editor visit with hospitalization within @card@ days. selected epidemiological and clinical characteristic , such as old age , hypoxia define by P/F , and cognitive impairment be independently associate with an increase likelihood of return hospital admission . further investigation be need to develop risk stratification tool , which help physician to choose the good disposition for patient with COVID-19 in the editor .

Atorvastatin associate with decrease hazard for death in COVID-19 patient admit to an ICU : a retrospective cohort study To the editor , since the World Health Organization ( who ) declare the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) a pandemic , the medical community start a race against time to find effective treatment for this disease [ 1 ] . Atorvastatin as adjuvant immunomodulatory therapy be of particular interest give its low cost , know safety profile , and availability . the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) have be show to interact with Toll-like receptor on the host cell membrane , increase the expression of the MYD88 gene , ultimately activate NF-κB and trigger inflammatory pathway . experimental model have demonstrate that statins stabilize MYD88 level after a pro-inflammatory trigger , and , in a murine model , atorvastatin significantly attenuate NF-κB activation [ 2 ] . furthermore , in the real world , two retrospective cohort study report a reduce risk of influenza death among statin user [ 3 , 4 ] . therefore , we assess whether statin user at a dose of @card@ mg daily have reduce inpatient mortality hazard from COVID-19 . in this retrospective cohort study , we use a de-identified dataset that include @card@ adult patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admit to our community hospital intensive care unit ( ICU ) locate in Evanston , Il , from March to May @card@ . we perform a Cox proportional hazard ( PH ) regression model to examine the relationship between adjuvant treatment and inpatient mortality . To minimize confounder , we adjust for age , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , invasive mechanical ventilation , severity accord to the National Institutes of Health criterion ( respiratory rate > @card@ , SpO2 < @card@ % , PaO2/FiO2  @card@ % ) , number of comorbidities ( as a continuous variable ) , and other adjuvant therapy ( include hydroxychloroquine , intravenous steroid , azithromycin , tocilizumab , colchicine , and antibiotic ) , force these variable into the model . we also perform a sensitivity analysis calculate the E value ( with the low confidence limit ) as describe by VanderWeele et al . [ 5 , 6 ] for the obtain point estimate . the E value be define as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome , conditional on the measure covariates , to explain away a specific exposure-outcome association fully . the median age be @card@ year ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 58–75 year ) , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be male , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) be skilled nurse facility resident . of these patient , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be ultimately discharge from the hospital , median length of stay @card@ day ( IQR , 7 to @card@ day ) , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) have die , median length of stay @card@ day ( IQR , 3 to @card@ day ) , a statistically significant difference ( p = @card@ by Mann-Whitney U test ) . a total of @card@ ( @card@ % ) survivor receive atorvastatin @card@ mg daily compare to @card@ ( @card@ % ) of non-survivors ( p = @card@ by chi-squared ) . in the multivariable Cox PH regression model , atorvastatin non-user have a @card@ % chance of fast progression to death compare with atorvastatin user ( when probability = HR/HR + 1 ) ( Table 1 ) . the E value for the point estimate be @card@ and the E value for the low confidence interval be @card@ , mean that a confounder not include in the multivariable Cox PH regression model associate with atorvastatin use and inpatient mortality in patient with COVID-19 by a hazard ratio of 1.69-fold each could explain away the low confidence limit , but weak confound could not . in conclusion , we find a slow progression to death associate with atorvastatin in patient with COVID-19 admit to our ICU . give the observational nature of this study , result should be take with caution ; randomize controlled trial be need to confirm this benefit ( STATCO19 , identifier NCT04380402 ) . To date , supportive care remain the mainstay of therapy , and the clinical efficacy for various treatment be still under investigation .   chest CT Features of @card@ patient with Mild Coronavirus Disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) Pneumonia : a Longitudinal , Retrospective and Descriptive Study this article be publish with digital feature , include a summary slide , to facilitate understanding of the article . To view digital feature for this article go to https : //doi . org/10.6084/m9 . figshare.13007915 . the World Health Organization ( who ) report that as of July 6 , @card@ , there be ten million confirm case of coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) worldwide , include @card@ death [ 1 ] . these figure be update daily , and subsequently , the situation have largely deteriorate depend on geographical location . among confirm case report in China , @card@ % of @card@ patient experience mild pneumonia [ 2 ] . compute tomography ( CT ) be instrumental for screening and effective evaluation of patient with COVID-19 [ 3 ] , and understand CT performance be of vital clinical significance for control the pandemic . nevertheless , to our knowledge , the scope of study investigate the evolution of CT finding in COVID-19 be limit [ 4–9 ] . for example , Wang et al . [ 5 ] , Zhou et al . [ 6 ] , and Pan et al . [ 8 ] focus on the evolution of imaging performance within @card@ or @card@ day after the onset of symptom , while more than @card@ or @card@ day after illness onset be classify as the last stage . however , the time from illness onset to ICU admission be @card@ ( IQR 8 , @card@ ) day [ @card@ ] . therefore , focus on @card@ or @card@ day after illness onset as the last stage may obscure a critical change in disease course . furthermore , certain study [ 6–9 ] analyze patient with mild as well as severe pneumonia , which may bias the result . for example , Liang et al . [ 4 ] analyze only the CT finding of patient who be not discharge from the hospital during the first 3 week after admission , and Shi et al . include only the initial CT date of all patient [ 7 ] . therefore , a large-scale longitudinal study on the CT manifestation of patient with mild COVID-19 pneumonia be urgently require . here we describe the evolution of CT appearance in @card@ patient with mild COVID-19 with definitive outcome ( all patient be discharge and none become severely or critically ill or die ) . we aim to compare the CT finding across the disease course and analyze the correlation between CT score and inpatient day , which may be helpful for understand the nature of disease and for optimally manage patient . chest CT image without contrast be acquire use a single inspiratory phase use two CT scanner ( SOMATOM Definition AS , Siemens Healthineers , Erlangen , Germany ; uCT @card@ , United Imaging , Shanghai , China ) . all patient be supine when examine . the CT protocol be as follow : @card@ kVp ; 120–200 mA ; slice thickness 5–10 mm. ; matrix @card@ × @card@ ; pitch @card@ . the reconstruction section thickness be 0.5–1 mm. . we collect CT scan of patient from admission to discharge . Two radiologist with @card@ and @card@ year of experience in chest imaging , respectively , evaluate the CT image to reach a consensus diagnosis . definition of CT imaging feature refer to in the Fleischner Society glossary and peer-reviewed literature on viral pneumonia [ 7 , 14–16 ] . the observer review the image feature as follow : lung involvement , extent of lesion involvement , predominant location , margin definition , distribution , lung segment of lesion distribution , number of lung segment and lobe involved , predominant CT pattern ( Fig . 2 ) , pure ground-glass opacity ( GGO ) , pure consolidation , GGO and consolidation , linear opacity , adjacent pleuron thickening , nodule , round\n",
            "cystic change , bronchiectasis , air bronchogram sign , bronchial wall thickening , interlobular septal thickening , crazy-paving pattern , pleural effusion , thoracic lymphadenopathy , honeycomb pattern , tree-in-bud , reverse halo sign , calcification , and cavitation . observer refer to a severity score system [ @card@ ] . each lung be divide into upper , low , and middle zone accord to the horizontal line through the carina and inferior pulmonary vein ( six zone ) . the score rule for the involvement of each zone be as follow : score 0 = 0 % ; score 1 , less than @card@ % involvement ; score 2 , @card@ % to less than @card@ % ; score 3 , @card@ % to less than @card@ % ; and score 4 , @card@ % or high . the total severity score represent the sum of the score of the six zone ( possible score , 0–24 ) . the total lesion score represent the total score of involved lesion . we further evaluate the individual total score for GGO , consolidation , and linear opacity of all lesion . To obtain detailed information about the dynamic evolution of CT feature with disease progression , we divide the time axis into @card@ period accord to the decile interval of the time from the onset of illness : stage 1 ( 1–5 day ) , stage 2 ( 6–8 day ) , stage 3 ( 9–11 day ) , stage 4 ( 12–14 day ) , stage 5 ( 15–16 day ) , stage 6 ( 17–18 day ) , stage 7 ( 19–21 day ) , stage 8 ( 22–25 day ) , stage 9 ( 26–30 day ) , and stage @card@ ( more than @card@ day ) . the date of disease onset be define as patient ' report date of symptom onset . moreover , study evaluate the therapeutic effect of the COVID-19 typically require 1 week [ 17–19 ] . therefore , to provide a reference for subsequent research on the evaluation of the therapeutic effect , we define each week as one stage to further explore the dynamic change in CT score and imaging performance . the time axis be accordingly divide as follow : week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and after 4 week . finally , we analyze the correlation between inpatient day and weekly CT score . statistical analysis be perform use IBM SPSS Statistics Software ( version @card@ ; IBM , New York , USA ) . continuous variable be express as the mean and standard deviation ( SD ) or median and interquartile range ( IQRs ) , as appropriate . categorical variable be summarize as count and/or percentage . the Kruskal–Wallis test be use to evaluate the difference among continuous variable of each stage , and a trend test be perform use a polynomial contrast procedure . the chi-square test be use to evaluate the difference between categorical variable in each stage , and the trend test be use with the chi-square test or curve fitting . correlation coefficient be then calculate between inpatient day and CT score use Spearman correlation analysis . P value less than @card@ ( two-tailed ) be consider significant , and the comparison between specific pairwise comparison use the adjusted P value . in this research , @card@ patient with @card@ CT scan be ultimately enroll . patient ' median age be @card@ year ( IQR @card@ , @card@ ; Table 1 ) . the most common symptom be fever ( @card@ , @card@ % ) and cough ( @card@ , @card@ % ) . all patient meet the discharge criterion , and the lung lesion of 3 ( @card@ % ) patient be completely absorb upon discharge . of the @card@ CT scan ( CTs ) , @card@ be negative , and we therefore focus on the lesion score and characteristic of the positive CTs . in the dynamic evolution of the @card@ stage , the number of CTs of each stage be @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ , respectively . there be significant difference between different stage in score ( Fig . 3a ) . the difference between specific pairwise comparison be show in Fig . 3b . we find two peak in the change trend of the total lesion score : stage 3 ( 9–11 day ) and stage 6 ( 17–18 day ) , score = @card@ ± @card@ and @card@ ± @card@ , respectively . the three peak of the GGO score occur during stage 3 ( 9–11 day ) , stage 6 ( 17–18 day ) , and stage 8 ( 22–25 day ) , with score of @card@ ± @card@ , @card@ ± @card@ , and @card@ ± @card@ , respectively . the consolidation score peak during stage 6 ( 17–18 day , score = @card@ ± @card@ ) . the linear opacity score peak during stage 6 ( score = @card@ ± @card@ ) . the number of lung segment and lobe involvement peak during stage 6 ( score = @card@ ± @card@ and @card@ ± @card@ , respectively ) , conform to a quadratic function ( Fig . 3c ) . furthermore , there be a significant difference in the number of involve lung segment during different stage . specific pairwise comparison be show in Fig . 3d . in contrast , when a 1-week interval be use and the time axis be divide into five stage , the number of CTs in each stage be @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ . in the dynamic evolution of five stage , there be significant difference in total lesion ( P < @card@ ) , consolidation ( P < @card@ ) , and linear opacity ( P < @card@ ) score ( Fig . 4a ) . the difference between the specific pairwise comparison be show in Fig . 4b . the total lesion score , GGO score , consolidation score , and linear opacity score peak during week 3 ( @card@ ± @card@ ) , week 2 ( @card@ ± @card@ ) , week 2 ( @card@ ± @card@ ) , and week 3 ( @card@ ± @card@ ) , respectively . the total lesion score and GGO score show significantly positive correlation with the inpatient day 4 week after the onset of the disease ( r range 0.26–0.31 , P < @card@ ) ( Table 2 ) . the number of lung segment and the extent of lobe involvement remain high during week 2–4 , and the curve conform to a quadratic function ( Fig . 4c ) . further , there be significant difference in the number of lung segment and lung lobe involvement during each stage . the specific pairwise comparison be show in Fig . 4d . image feature be summarize in Fig . 4 . in each stage , lesion , which be mainly bilateral ( 86–94 % ) , multiple ( 76–83 % ) , and ill-defined ( 46–61 % ) , be locate in the subpleural ( 78–85 % ) and peripheral area ( 78–85 % ) of both lung . the percentage of the well-defined margin of the lesion conform to a quadratic function ( Fig . 5a ) . the lesion more frequently involve the apical posterior ( 54–76 % ) , superior ( 68–87 % ) , posterior basal ( 68–80 % ) , and lateral basal segment ( 65–78 % ) of the leave lung ; and the posterior ( 59–75 % ) , lateral ( 55–73 % ) , superior ( 68–88 % ) , posterior basal ( 68–83 % ) , and lateral basal segment ( 65–82 % ) of the right lung ( Fig . 5b , c ) . the predominant CT pattern differ significantly during each stage ( P < @card@ ) , and GGO be the most common pattern in each stage ( 33–46 % ) ( Fig . 5d ) . the percentage of the GGO and consolidation opacity exhibit a linearly decrease trend ( P < @card@ ) ( Fig . 5e ) . the proportion of the pure GGO maintain a high value during each stage ( 72–82 % ) , peak during stage 2 ( week 2 ) and stage 5 ( after 4 week ) . the change trend of the percentage of pure consolidation and linear opacity be similar to the change trend of the consolidation and linear opacity score , and the percentage of both peak during week 3 . among other imaging sign , pleural thickening ( 56–74 % ) , interlobular septal thickening ( 26–48 % ) , and the crazy-paving pattern ( 15–35 % ) be relatively common , while lymphadenopathy ( 5–9 % ) , pleural effusion ( 0–5 % ) , and reverse halo sign ( 0–3 % ) be relatively infrequent ( Fig . 5f , g ) . To the good of our knowledge , of all the longitudinal CT performance study of COVID-19 pneumonia [ 4–8 ] , the present study analyze the large number of patient . through the study of @card@ COVID-19 CT image of @card@ patient , we find that the total lesion CT score propose by other only consider the area of involvement of the lesion , but not the nature of the lesion [ 4 , 6 , 8 , 20–22 ] , which may lead to delay of imaging evaluation in clinical practice [ @card@ ] . therefore , accord to the nature and area of the lesion , we first evaluate consolidation , linear opacity , and GGO score . second , although the total lesion score peak during day 9–11 , similar to previous report [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] , we find it interesting that the peak of the total lesion score be highest during day @card@ and @card@ , because this be not report by other . third , the peak time of the four CT score be basically consistent during the @card@ stage . however , if the interval be extend to 1 week , the peak time of the total CT score lag behind those of the consolidation and GGO score , suggest that a useful score system should include comprehensive assessment of the extent and histopathology of the lesion . the peak time of the total lesion score differ among previous study [ 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 ] . these study define the last stage of pneumonia as day @card@ or @card@ after disease onset . however , the average time from illness onset to discharge report by other investigator be approximately @card@ day [ @card@ , @card@ ] , and more than @card@ day after illness onset be a critical period for disease progression [ @card@ ] . therefore , we speculate that the staging method of these study report the average of the true peak of the total lesion score . clearly , in our research , the 10-stage curve confirm our prediction that the total lesion score peak during day 9–11 as well as on day 17–18 . the latter peak correspond to week 3 of the five-stage curve , while the previous peak be average . in addition , the peak time of the consolidation score be earlier than that of the total score of the five-stage change , and the curve of the consolidation score conform to a quadratic function . moreover , the decrease time of the total lesion score be later than the improvement time of clinical parameter [ @card@ ] , and great consolidation may indicate disease progression [ @card@ ] . therefore , the consolidation score may reflect the severity of disease more promptly than the total lesion score , although the change of the two score may tend to be associate with the increase of the number of stage . among the typical feature of each stage , here we show that COVID-19 pneumonia be mainly characterize by bilateral , multiple , and ill-defined lesion , with a GGO pattern , locate in the posterior and peripheral region of both lung , similar to previous finding [ 5–7 , 9 ] . in the predominant CT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia , the GGO and linear opacity pattern increase rapidly from week 3 after disease onset . histologically , GGO represent interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and edema [ @card@ ] , while during the absorption stage , the absorption of exudate cell and hyaline membrane in the lung tissue form other lesion such as consolidation and the crazy-paving pattern , gradually transform into GGO . evidence indicate that linear opacity be an organized feature during the late stage of disease [ @card@ ] . therefore , good prognosis may be associate with increase in the proportion of the GGO and linear opacity pattern during the late stage of disease . however , the increase in the total score and GGO score during stage 5 ( after week 4 ) may indicate an extension of hospital stay . furthermore , the proportion of the consolidation pattern and the consolidation score peak during week 2 after disease onset and gradually decrease , suggest that the event that occur during week 2 may be critical for disease progression . in the present study , the change trend of the proportion of consolidation , GGO , and linear opacity be not completely consistent with the change trend of their respective score , suggest that previous study [ 7 , @card@ ] , base only on the proportion of lesion use to judge the severity of the disease , may have generate unreliable result . thus , the proportion of lesion and the area involve should therefore be simultaneously consider . here , pleural thickening and interlobular septal thickening be relatively common CT sign during each stage . the crazy-paving pattern sign be relatively common during the first 2 week after illness onset , and pleural effusion appear during the first 3 week . obviously , CT play an important role in control the spread of COVID-19 . however , CT have some insurmountable shortcoming , such as high cost , exposure to radiation , and their immobile nature , which can be overcome by lung ultrasound ( LUS ) [ 28–31 ] . couple with the fact that the lesion of COVID-19 tend to occur in subpleural region , LUS have be suggest as a potential triage and diagnostic tool for COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . the late research show that LUS be a promising tool for early risk stratification in COVID-19 , which may guide patient ' management strategy , as well as resource allocation in case of surge capacity [ @card@ , @card@ ] . there be some limitation to our study . first , this be a single-center study , and the result require verification through a multicenter study . second , the CT score of this study may not be comparable with the quantitative score determine use artificial intelligence [ @card@ ] , although visual score be easy to determine . finally , only patient with mild COVID-19 pneumonia be include , and the longitudinal CT performance of severe pneumonia must be determine use a large sample size . the total lesion score of mild COVID-19 pneumonia peak 17–18 day after illness onset , and week 2 after onset may be the critical period for disease progression . the consolidation score may objectively reflect the severity of lung involvement and thus serve as a more accurate diagnostic measure than total lesion score . the mild COVID-19 pneumonia in each stage be mainly manifest as bilateral , multiple , and ill-defined lesion , with the GGO pattern , and locate in the posterior and peripheral area of both lung . moreover , good prognosis may be associate with increase in the proportion of the GGO and linear opacity pattern during the late stage of disease .   mathematical analysis of a measles transmission dynamics model in Bangladesh with double dose vaccination many people be be infect every year by serious respiratory infectious disease , include measles . a significant number of them die or suffer severe illness and life-long complications1–5 . the annual report on the estimated number of measles case and measles cause death worldwide be announce by the World Health Organization ( who ) and UNICEF base on the report datum of the member country . accord to who and UNICEF statistic for @card@ , the total measles case and measles-related death be record at @card@ and @card@ , respectively . in @card@ , there be about @card@ recorded measles case and @card@ measles cause deaths6 . the maximum case be report from Madagascar , Ukraine , Somalia and Liberia . also , some develop country , include the United Kingdom , Greece , Czechia , and Albania , lose the elimination status of measles in the late year . moreover , the United States count the maximum number of case , which be highest in @card@ year , in @card@ . in @card@ , the maximum number of @card@ people die due to measles , and the report measles case be @card@ globally7 . this year , Madagascar , Ukraine and Congo have report the high number of case . outbreak be continuous in Angola , Cameroon , Kazakhstan , Chad , Nigeria , Thailand , Philippine , South Sudan and Sudan8 . these continuous annually increment be indicate a matter of concern issue in the world . measles be one of the most contagious respiratory infectious disease cause by the measles virus that live in an infected person’s nose and throat mucus . it be a virus of paramyxovirus family , genus morbilivirus , and this virus be find only in the human body among all animal species1,2 . this virus can be spread directly from person to person through cough and sneeze of the infected person . the clinical symptom of measles be high fever , runny nose , cough , conjunctivitis , rhinitis , small white spot and a rash in the body of the infected people . this disease be more dangerous , especially for child under five year of age and adult old than @card@ year of age . the complication include pneumonia , mouth ulcer , sinus and ear infection , diarrhea , malnutrition , blindness and brain damage may occur due to measles3 . there be no specific medicine for the treatment of infected people with measles . accord to the complication of the patient , a specific treatment may be suggest . patient may need complete bed rest , fluid , control of fever and pain , and antibiotics9 . now , the measles vaccine be available , which be effective and inexpensive , and it have be possible to remarkably reduce the number of people die from measles through vaccination5 . the measles , mump , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine efficacy be @card@ % for prevent measles if the first dose be give to child at @card@ month of age , and the efficacy increase to @card@ % after the second dose be give to child at great than @card@ month of age10 . many country and various public health organization such as who , UNICEF , American Red Cross , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and United Nations Foundation have conduct tremendous effort worldwide to fight against measles . these organization launch the Measles and Rubella Initiative ( MRI ) , a global partnership among these organization to stop measles and rubella , in @card@ to reduce measles death globally by @card@ % by @card@ compare to @card@ estimates11 . presently , this partnership have take the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework 2021–2030 ( MRSF 2021–2030 ) for a world free from measles and rubella12 . however , despite be vaccine-preventable , measles be still a public health problem in many develop country globally , especially in part of Asia and Africa , because of low awareness , civil strife , vaccine hesitancy , low immunization system and poor health infrastructures13 . in Bangladesh , one of the South East Asia Region ( Sear ) country , measles outbreak occur several time in different area during 2000–2016 . there be about @card@ report measles case and @card@ confirm measles case in Bangladesh during this period14 . although the expanded program of Immunization ( EPI ) be start in Bangladesh in @card@ to control and prevent measles15 , the government adopt more initiative like strengthen the surveillance system and introduction of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine ( MCV2 ) in @card@ to eliminate measles from the country by @card@ . consequently , measles case be reduce up to @card@ % over the last decade . however , the number of estimated measles case have be increase since @card@ nationwide . despite some existing challenge , Rohingya refugee be another challenge for the removal of measles from Bangladesh . in recent decade , the research relate to measles in epidemiology have be one of the most important research field to researcher . many researcher have already propose their idea and accomplish their research mathematically , theoretically or experimentally , use different deterministic or compartmental model , to find the comparatively good way for measles control and prevention , focus on different area of the world , for example , London17 , Afghanistan18 , Kenya19 , Madagascar20 , Ontario21 , Cape Coast22 , Italy23 , Senegal23 , Taiwan24 and China25,26 . moreover , Momoh et al.27 study an SEIR deterministic epidemic model to investigate the impact of asymptomatic individual at the latent period on measles dynamics . Adewale et al.28 develop a mathematical model to ascertain the effect of distance between infected and non-infected person in control the measles virus transmission . they observe that the number of infected individual decrease due to increase in distance between infected and susceptible person . also , two study highlight the efficiency of vaccination in control and prevention of measles transmission29,30 . Garba et al.31 also study a compartmental mathematical model to examine the effect of vaccination and treatment on measles dynamics . Beay4 propose a SIQR epidemic model and accomplish the numerical analysis of the model to explore the effect of treatment and quarantine on measles dynamics . the study demonstrate that the combined application of quarantine and treatment be more effective to control and prevent measles . it also observe that the measles spread reduce due to the treatment and quarantine of infected individual . in this study , we develop a novel compartmental measles model to simulate the prevalence of measles estimation in Bangladesh . we use the next-generation matrix method to determine the basic reproduction number of the system and find that this be an essential determinant for disease dynamics . To supplement and validate the analytic process , we use numerical technique to solve the model equation and explore the epidemic trajectory for a range of possible parameter value and initial condition . the local stability analysis of the disease-free and endemic equilibria be examine use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion . follow this , we perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the model parameter that greatly influence measles prevalence . finally , we investigate the impact of progression rate , transmission rate and double dose vaccination on the dynamics of the measles outbreak . we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics measles model between the follow mutually exclusive compartment : susceptible individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{S}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}S(t ) ; those who have not yet infect with the disease but might become infected ; first dose vaccinate individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{V}}_{1}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}V1(t ) ; those who have receive the first dose of vaccine ; second dose vaccinate individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{V}}_{2}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}V2(t ) ; those who have receive the second dose of vaccine ; exposed individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}E(t ) ; represent those that be infected and have not yet develop active measles disease ; infected individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{I}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}I(t ) ; those who be infected and infectious ; and Recovered individual , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}R(t ) ; those who be previously infect and successfully recover . individual in the recovery class be neither infectious nor susceptible , include people in treatment , isolation , no longer contact other or dead . the total population size \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{t})$$\\end{document}N(t ) be assume to be constant and well mixed:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \\usepackage{amsmath } \\usepackage{wasysym } \\usepackage{amsfonts } \\usepackage{amssymb } \\usepackage{amsbsy } \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \\usepackage{upgreek } \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{t})=\\mathrm{S}(\\mathrm{t})+{\\mathrm{V}}_{1}(\\mathrm{t})+{\\mathrm{V}}_{2}(\\mathrm{t})+\\mathrm{E}(\\mathrm{t})+\\mathrm{I}(\\mathrm{t})+\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{t } ) . $$\\end{document}N(t)=S(t)+V1(t)+V2(t)+E(t)+I(t)+R(t ) .

good way to control an outbreak of measles . numerical analysis have reveal that vaccination have a negative impact on the prevalence of measles . this finding indicate that the improvement in vaccination dose rate decrease the spread of measles . therefore , to attain a high level of herd immunity for the disease , mass vaccination exercise should be encourage to cover most of the

p22t , p23t , p32t , p33t , p34t , p43t , p44t≤1 p11t+p12t=1 p21t+p22t+p23t=1 p32t+p33t+p34t=1 p43t+p44t=1 . the number of the response to the web questionnaire at time t , or tth Poll , be aggregate as the proportion yit , i=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . here , yi0 be assume to be the datum at t=0 , or the status before the COVID-19 pandemic . all of the hospital be not restrict as y10=1 and y20=y30=y40=0 . when the individual transition be not available , it be not possible to estimate the transition matrix from individual transition datum use the ordinary least square method . however , the quadratic programming method could estimate a transition matrix from proportional datum [ @card@ ] . a model of the relation between the actual response count and estimated occurrence of yit be describe below with the error term ujt : ( 3)yjt+1=∑i4yitpijt+ujt . this equation could be write in linear algebraic form as follow : ( 4)yt=Xtpt+ut , where ( 5)yt=y1t , y1t+1 , y2t , y2t+1 , y3t , y3t+1 , y4t , y4t+1′ , and ( 6)Xjt=y1t−1y2t−1y3t−1y4t−1y1ty2ty3ty4t , for j=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 so that ( 7)Xt=X1t0000X2t0000X3t0000X4t , ( 8)pt=p1t , p1t+1 , p2t , p2t+1 , p3t , p3t+1 , p4t , p4t+1′ , and ( 9)ut=u1t , u1t+1 , u2t , u2t+1 , u3t , u3t+1 , u4t , u4t+1′ . estimation be perform minimize the square error term ut2 as ( 10)ut2=yt−Xtpt2 =yt2−2yt′Xtpt+pt′Xt′Xtpt . the objective of quadratic programming be to find a vector pt that would minimize ( 11)12pt′Xt′Xtpt−yt′Xtpt , subject to ( 12)Apt≤b , where a be the coefficient matrix of pt and b be a real vector corresponding to coefficient of equality or inequality for pt denote in Equation ( 2 ) . the restriction rate of the number of general anesthesia be assume for each response of the survey : ( 1 ) “ no surgical restriction ” be almost the same ( @card@ % ) as the past statistics , ( 2 ) “ partial restriction ” be about @card@ % restriction rate compare to the past statistics , ( 3 ) “ extensive restriction ” be about @card@ % restriction rate compare to the past statistic , and ( 4 ) “ no schedule surgery ” be about @card@ % restriction rate compare to the past statistic ( Figure 2 ) . under such assumption , the restriction rate for each hospital h of the restriction status i at week t , xt , i , h be generate from the gamma distribution ( 13)Gammax ; α , β=βαxα−1e−βx∫0∞tα−1e−tdt , where α>0 and β>0 . their parameter αi , βi , i=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 be define so that the median of the gamma distribution corresponding to the restriction status be @card@ for “ no surgical restriction , ” @card@ for “ partial restriction , ” @card@ for “ extensive restriction , ” and @card@ for “ no schedule surgery , ” and the variance of the gamma distribution be @card@ , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . the number of general anesthesia perform at hospital h in the tth week , Rh , t , be generate by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation as follow : ( 14)xt , i , h∼Gammaαi , βi , ( 15)Rh , t=Nhxt , i , h , where Nh be the reference number of the general anesthesia perform at hospital h ( datum available from e-Stat ) . the response to the survey for each hospital at t=1 be randomly allocate to the ith response accord to yi1 and its status transitioned to the jth response by pijt . for sensitivity analysis , two other scenario be consider . an optimistic scenario assume relatively high performance in operate room , with an average of @card@ % for “ 2 . partial restriction , ” @card@ % for “ 3 . extensive restriction , ” and @card@ % for “ 4 . no schedule surgery . ” a pessimistic scenario assume extremely low performance , with an average of @card@ % for “ 2 . partial restriction , ” @card@ % for “ 3 . extensive restriction , ” and 3 % for “ 4 . no schedule surgery . ” analysis and estimation be perform use the quadprog package ( version @card@ ) within the R programming language ( version @card@ ) . point estimate and their statistical uncertainty be present as @card@ % confidential interval ( CI ) with @card@ iteration . the datum be obtain from the Japan official statistic portal site ( e-Stat ) , a public database in Japan ( https : //www . e-stat . go . jp/stat-search/file-download ? statInfId=000031682822&fileKind=0 access on 8 February @card@ ) , and be preprocessed for analysis . this dataset contain the label of “ row id , ” “ hospital id , ” “ hospital name , ” “ total number , ” “ with surgery , ” “ with chemotherapy , ” “ with radiation therapy , ” “ with ambulance transfer , ” “ either , ” “ general anesthesia , ” and their percentage in Japanese . the number of general anesthesia be define as general anesthesia perform with an open drop system or closed circulation system in the Japanese healthcare system . the column “ hospital name ” and “ general anesthesia ” be extract from the XLS file for preprocessing . the code and preprocessed dataset be available online ( https : //github . com/yfujii08/covid19generalanesthesia access on 8 February @card@ ) and available upon request from the corresponding author . the JSA search the extent of the restriction of general anesthesia by questionnaire . they send questionnaire to all the authorized institutes ( n = @card@ ) from @card@ April @card@ approximately every week . the proportion of the number of general anesthesia compare to the previous year be estimate and disclose to only the member of JSA ( https : //anesth . or . jp/img/upload/ckeditor/files/2004_07_08 . pdf access on 8 February @card@ ) . the JSA ask its authorized member in a questionnaire whether they have prepare a special operate room for the patient with COVID-19 , how many surgery be perform in the week when they respond to the questionnaire , and how many surgery be perform in the previous year , and they report the regional difference . the result of the percentage of surgery compare to the previous year be use . the similarity between our estimation and the JSA result be measure with a correlation coefficient . the estimated value for the Twitter poll and JSA report could not be directly compare because the timepoints , or date , of Twitter poll and the JSA report be different . the unpaired value be linearly interpolate and the correlation coefficient , r , be define as ( 16)rfPolls , fJSA=∑fPolls−f¯PollsfJSA−f¯JSA∑fPolls−f¯Polls2∑fJSA−f¯JSA2 , where fPolls be the estimation from Twitter poll with the interpolate value corresponding to the date of the JSA report . f¯Polls be the mean of fPolls , and analogously for fJSA . this study be exempt from institutional review board approval because this study do not contain human participant or research material derive from human participant . from @card@ March @card@ to @card@ August @card@ , @card@ survey response be solicit approximately weekly via a Twitter account ( @dajhiroki ) in the Japanese language , with the number of response receive range from @card@ to @card@ ( Supplementary Information S1 ) . in the public database ( e-Stat ) , @card@ hospital be register as facility that provide general anesthesia . of the @card@ hospital that report the number of general anesthesia case , @card@ perform more than @card@ case of general anesthesia . from the survey conduct in the first week ( @card@ March @card@ ) , @card@ % have no surgical restriction , but this proportion decrease to @card@ % in the survey conduct in the seventh week ( @card@ April @card@ ) and slightly recover to @card@ % ( @card@ May @card@ ) . the proportion recover to @card@ % ( 4 July @card@ ) , and finally recover to @card@ % at the end of the questionnaire ( @card@ August @card@ ) . the proportion of partial restriction , extensive restriction , and no schedule surgery be @card@ % , @card@ % , and @card@ % ( @card@ March @card@ ) ; @card@ % , @card@ % , and @card@ % ( @card@ April @card@ ) ; @card@ % , @card@ % , and @card@ % ( @card@ May @card@ ) ; and @card@ % , @card@ % , and @card@ % ( @card@ August @card@ ) , respectively ( Figure 3 ) . the estimated proportion of each response and its transition be show in Figure 3 . the number of general anesthesia perform decrease as the restriction increase ( Figure 4 ) . before COVID-19 , @card@ × @card@ case of general anesthesia be perform per week in Japan . the number of general anesthesia ( @card@ case per week unit ) be estimate to be @card@ [ @card@ % CI : @card@ , @card@ ] in the first-week survey ( @card@ March @card@ ) , @card@ [ @card@ , @card@ ] in the seventh-week survey ( @card@ April @card@ ) and @card@ [ @card@ , @card@ ] in the last week survey ( @card@ August @card@ ) . sensitivity analysis show that the number of general anesthesia perform decrease accord to the intensity of the restriction ( Figure 5 ) . from the first week of the survey ( @card@ March @card@ ) , the optimistic scenario have a median of @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % compare to @card@ ) , while the pessimistic scenario have a median of @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % ) . from the seventh week of the survey ( @card@ April @card@ ) , the optimistic scenario median be @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % ) , while that of the pessimistic scenario be @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % ) , respectively . from the last week of the survey ( @card@ August @card@ ) , the optimistic scenario median be @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % ) , while that of the pessimistic scenario be @card@ × @card@ cases/week ( @card@ % ) . the maximum difference between optimistic and pessimistic scenario be 1.32-fold on 2 May @card@ . the comparison between the estimation of this survey and the nationwide report from the survey of the JSA be show in Figure 5 . the datum before the end of April be miss because the questionnaire start on @card@ April @card@ . the JSA datum show a gradual decrease in the number of general anesthesia compare to the previous year , with @card@ % on @card@ April , @card@ % on @card@ April , and @card@ % on 4 May , respectively . as JSA point out , there be a drastic decrease on 3 May and @card@ July . these decline come from sequential national holiday . the former decline result from “ Golden Week ” in Japan , with an extra two holiday compare to the same week of the previous year , while the latter result from sequential holiday designate for the Olympic year , add two holiday in the week . after that , the number of general anesthesia case , as well as the estimation base on this survey , gradually recover . there be significant correlation between estimate and JSA report ( correlation coefficient r = @card@ , p < @card@ ) . it be difficult to adequately control for the level of limitation of usual surgical care during the expansion of COVID-19 . it be determine by adherence to official guideline , restriction on medical supply and medical staff , and the level of need for surgery . still , because circumstance can change quickly , it be often determine by reference to the extent of restriction at a medical facility other than the home facility . the stage approach—recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and the American College of Surgeons ( ACS)—was use as a guide to determine how to perform surgery in situation where the preservation of ventilator and personal protective equipment be necessary and where the ICU have be compromise or be expect to be compromise soon . the impact of COVID-19 on general anesthesia have not be quantifiably evaluate [ @card@ ] but new evidence be emerge . a nationwide questionnaire survey in Turkey demonstrate that @card@ % of the responder stop elective surgery after the first case be report in Turkey ( @card@ March @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . a cross-sectional analysis in northwest England report that the general anesthesia rate for Cesarean section be significantly reduce from @card@ % to @card@ % due to the COVID-19 pandemic [ @card@ ] . the large , late nationwide survey from the COVIDSurg group show that @card@ % of surgery be cancel or postpone during the 12-week peak of disruption cause by the COVID-19 pandemic [ @card@ ] . they report a @card@ % cancellation rate for Japan [ @card@ ] , which be much large than our estimate . however , their estimate be base on another survey which report that the Japanese surgical volume range from @card@ to @card@ million [ @card@ ] , which would include regional anesthesia . regard cancer surgery , which should be assume to be perform under general anesthesia , Japanese cancellation rate be estimate as @card@ range from @card@ to @card@ . this quantification be compatible with our result . use a series of survey conduct through Twitter poll , we be able to quickly determine the extent of the restriction on surgery at medical facility across the country about one month ahead of the survey by the JSA . by periodically solicit response to the same survey on Twitter , we be able to estimate the extent to which operation would be restrict nationally over time . our methodology in this study be an estimation method that use mathematical analysis . in this study , we use public datum from a database operate by the Japanese government . the number of hospital accredit by the JSA be @card@ . however , in this study , @card@ hospital that perform at least @card@ surgery per year under general anesthesia be use . the number of operation perform at each hospital vary mainly accord to the size of the hospital . on the other hand , since neither the size of the hospital to which the survey respondent belong nor the change in the number of operation be know , we use mathematical analysis to calculate the number of operation . there be several limitation to this study . first , the number and type of survey response be a potential limitation . the number of anesthesiologist use Twitter be not sufficient to obtain the definitive estimation , and there may be some bias in term of the response from those that do use it . response be low initially , with @card@ in the early stage of the survey period . in the latter half of the survey period , response increase to @card@ . the grow penetration of the survey and increase familiarity with the issue of operate room restriction may have contribute to an increase in participation , but this may have be bias . second , we calculate the number of surgery as @card@ % for the criterion “ no surgical restriction , ” @card@ % for “ partial restriction , ” @card@ % for “ extensive restriction , ” and @card@ % for “ no schedule surgery . ” in the sensitivity analysis , two scenario be assume , but the number of general anesthesia case perform could have lead to a difference of approximately 1.32-fold follow the survey period . because it be difficult to estimate the accurate extent of restriction , intuitive value be adopt . the result need to be compare with the descriptive statistic after the era of COVID-19 . in conclusion , we analyze the result of a series of survey on Twitter on the status of operate restriction during the COVID-19 pandemic era use quadratic programming to solve a mathematical optimize problem , and public datum provide by the Japanese government be use to estimate and compare the current change in the number of general anesthesia carry out in Japan . the number of general anesthesia be reduce up to two-third during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and be successfully quantitatively estimate use a quick questionnaire on Twitter . the timeseries trend of the estimation be compare with the result of the survey sponsor by the JSA . the COVID-19 pandemic be ongoing worldwide . in this study , we apply this methodology to estimate the number of surgery with anesthesia during the so-called first wave in one region , Japan . however , this methodology can be apply to the analysis of several previous and current epidemic and can be use in field other than the estimation of the number of surgery . thus , it be consider to be a technique with rich applicability .   the Development of a Video intervention to Improve Senior Medical student ' performance on Outpatient Telephone Encounters : a Delphi Analysis and Randomized Controlled Trial New postgraduate trainee be often assign telephone medicine responsibility [ 1 , 2 ] with little prior training [ 3 , 4 ] . this may occur when cover an assign panel of continuity clinic patient or when working after-hour ( e. g. , night float ) [ 2 ] . telephone encounter address a variety of patient issue such as answer question , address concern , communicate result , and discuss plan . moreover , the importance of telemedicine ( “ the use of electronic information and communications technology to provide and support health care when distance separate participant , ” which include synchronous telephone medicine [ 5 ] , the focus of this study ) be increase dramatically due to the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) pandemic [ 6 , 7 ] . give the multiple challenge of remote communication , outpatient telephone call ( OTCs ) have be show to increase the potential for medical error [ 1 , 8–10 ] . as such , postgraduate trainee express discomfort with this task [ @card@ , @card@ ] . there be a need for telephone medicine curriculum to be incorporate in medical school [ @card@ ] . the importance of telephone medicine have be recognize by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Program Requirements for Family Medicine program , which specify that postgraduate trainee engage in telephone visit ( IV . C.4 . f. ) [ @card@ ] and incorporate telephone medicine as a Communication milestone ( C-4 ) [ @card@ ] . additionally , other health profession such as nurse recognize the importance of telehealth and offer formal training and telehealth credentialing [ @card@ ] . however , there be a general lack of guideline or curriculum available target learner at the medical student level [ @card@ ] . the few existing guideline pre-date the current ubiquitous use of Electronic Medical Records ( Emr ) [ @card@ , @card@ ] or be time-intensive [ @card@ ] . therefore , there be a need for an update OTC curriculum prior to the start of postgraduate training . One well-described way to increase preparedness for postgraduate training be through Residency Preparation Courses ( RPCs ) , which be course at the end of medical school intend to well prepare senior student for postgraduate expectation [ @card@ , @card@ ] . a strategy utilize in RPCs for both education and assessment be a mock page curriculum in which student receive page with simulated scenario and must communicate accordingly with either a simulated nurse ( inpatient scenario ) or a simulated patient ( outpatient scenario ) . mock page curriculum be generally well-receive by student [ 22–26 ] and have be show to improve confidence [ @card@ , @card@ ] , decrease anxiety [ @card@ ] , improve clinical decision make [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] , improve communication skill [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] , and improve attitude toward interprofessional communication and collaboration with nurse [ @card@ ] . we hypothesize that an educational intervention direct specifically at OTCs would improve student performance on mock outpatient page ( i. e. , simulated OTCs ) . our study address this question by first utilize a Delphi technique to determine the OTC skill important to teach student . second , we use this information to develop a brief video educational intervention . finally , we test the efficacy of the educational intervention with a randomize controlled trial involve senior medical student enroll in RPCs at a single institution . we invite seven faculty member and eleven postgraduate trainee from six different field ( Family Medicine , Internal Medicine , Internal Medicine-Pediatrics , Obstetrics and Gynecology , Pediatrics , and Surgery ) . they be invite base on outpatient clinical experience , experience with trainee , and experience in transition-to-postgraduate education . resident be invite because of their relatively recent experience transitioning from medical school to postgraduate training . respondent be ask to provide free-text response to three question regard what an intern should know to address OTCs : “ What be the most important skill for intern to know when interact with outpatient over the phone ? ” “ What be the most frequent challenge for which intern should be prepare when interact with outpatient over the phone ? What be the skill intern need to address these challenge ? ” “ What other thing should be include in a video to teach intern about interact with outpatient over the phone ? ” the author develop these question base on their clinical experience . similar response be collate by one author and verify by another . skill be categorize accord to theme ( e. g. , triage , communication , medical knowledge , etc. ) . see Appendix 1 for the full survey . the skill identify in the first round be send via Qualtrics , and respondent be ask to rank the importance of the skill on a 4-point Likert scale ( “ not at all important , ” “ slightly important , ” “ Very important , ” or “ Extremely important ” ) . a neutral middle point be exclude to compel participant to choose either importance or unimportance and to assist in calculation for consensus [ @card@ ] . the survey in the second round also include question regard respondent ' demographic and clinical experience ( Appendix 2 ) . result be analyze accord to importance ( important or not important ) and degree of consensus ( high consensus , approach consensus , no consensus ) . high consensus for a skill be important be define as ≥ @card@ % of respondent agree on a skill be “ Extremely ” or “ Very important ” [ @card@ ] . approach consensus for a skill be important be define as 50–79 % agree on a skill be “ Extremely ” or “ Very important . ” high consensus for a skill not be important be define as ≥ @card@ % of respondent agree on a skill be “ not at all ” or “ slightly important . ” Approaching consensus for a skill not be important be define as 50–79 % agree on a skill be “ not at all ” or “ slightly important . ” the skill select by the Delphi process be incorporate into a video intervention . this 8:38-min video present a schematic and algorithmic framework by which to address OTCs . select image from the video be available ( see fig . 3 and Supplementary Information ) . the video be a narrate Google Slides ( Alphabet Inc. , Mountain View , Ca , USA ) presentation record with Camtasia ( TechSmith , Okemos , Mi , USA ) . participant be senior medical student who be enroll in specialty-specific RPCs ( Family Medicine , Internal Medicine , Obstetrics and Gynecology , Pediatrics , or Surgery ) in February and March @card@ base on their career interest . participant be exclude from analysis if they drop out of the RPCs at any time , or if they do not complete ( e. g. , due to other scheduled RPC requirement ) or result be not available for both the pre- and post-intervention simulate OTCs . See Fig . 1 for further detail of study population . student be assess on their ability to manage OTCs base on their performance respond to simulated OTCs within a large mock page curriculum . the assessment use trained registered nurse act as standardized patient to page student with simulated outpatient scenario ; student would call the standardized patient to address their concern . these simulated OTCs have be use for several year as a part of our institution’s RPCs . the scenario present in these simulated OTCs be mean to represent outpatient scenario common to the RPC specialty ( e. g. , the scenario be different for Surgery compare to OB/GYN ) . student be grade accord to a previously establish expert-validated rubric base on a weighted checklist for each case . they earn point for what they “ Must do ” and “ Should do ” and be penalize point for what they “ Should not do ” and “ Must not do . ” these point contribute to an overall score which be report as a percentage . see Appendix 3 for an example case . student be stratify within their respective RPC and randomize into two group , Intervention and Control . student be randomize use a random number generator within Google Sheets ( Alphabet Inc. , Mountain View , Ca , USA ) . participant be blind to randomization . the Control group receive “ usual care , ” i. e. , there be no placebo . the nurse ( act as standardized patient ) be the outcome adjudicator and datum collector in that they evaluate the student accord to the primary outcome and record their score ; the nurse be blind to group assignment . the author who act as data analyst be not blind to group assignment ; however , he do not participate in the datum collection or any outcome adjudication . student receive a total of two simulated OTCs . both group receive Mock Page 1 over the course of 1 week and be score by the adjudicator accord to the rubric for the case . the intervention group be then send a link to the educational video via Qualtrics . the Qualtrics survey record whether a student open the link to the video . the follow week , both group then receive Mock Page 2 and be again score . after the conclusion of the simulated OTCs , the Control group be send the link to the educational video to view for edification ( see fig . 1 ) . after view the educational video , student be automatically redirect to two free-text survey question : What do you learn from this video that you do not learn previously during medical school ? What feedback do you have to improve this video for future student ? the primary outcome be the mean improvement in overall score pre- and post-intervention of intervention compare to Control . the secondary outcome be the perceive value of the video intervention base on survey comment about what skill be learn . the primary outcome be examine use an intention-to-treat analysis . difference between group be determine use a multivariate repeated measure analysis for significance ( p ≤ @card@ ) and Cohen’s d for effect size . the threshold for an educational intervention to be consider effective be a Cohen’s d > @card@ [ @card@ ] . the datum be analyze use JMP Pro @card@ ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) . respondent include @card@ faculty ( @card@ % ) and @card@ postgraduate trainee ( @card@ % ) in four specialty ( Internal Medicine , n = 5 ; Medicine-Pediatrics , n = 1 ; Obstetrics and Gynecology , n = 3 ; Surgery , n = 3 ) for a total response rate of @card@ % . see Table 1 for respondent characteristic . the first round of the Delphi process result in @card@ idea . these idea be collate into @card@ teachable skill within the category of communication with the patient ( n = @card@ ) , triage ( n = 6 ) , medical knowledge ( n = 5 ) , gather information ( n = 4 ) , logistic of telephone encounter ( n = 4 ) , documentation/communication with other provider ( n = 3 ) , available resource ( n = 3 ) , prescribe medication ( n = 1 ) , and follow-up ( n = 1 ) . Eighteen skill be important , with high consensus . sixteen skill be important , approach consensus . Five skill be not important , approach consensus . One skill be not important , with high consensus . all skill except the unimportant skill with high consensus be incorporate into the video intervention ( see Table 2 ) . Eighty-nine student enroll in the RPCs in February and March @card@ . Eighty-five be stratify and randomize into Control ( n = @card@ ) and Intervention ( n = @card@ ) group . Forty-one student in the Control group and @card@ student in the intervention group complete pre- and post-intervention assessment ( Fig . 1 ) . of the @card@ student that complete both pre- and post-intervention assessment in the intervention group , @card@ ( @card@ % ) access the link to view the video . the score for both group improve ; Control group score increase from @card@ ± SD @card@ % to @card@ ± @card@ % and intervention group score increase from @card@ ± @card@ % to @card@ ± @card@ % ( p = @card@ ) . the intervention have a notable effect as indicate by the medium effect size ( Cohen’s d = @card@ ) . value be tabulate in Table 3 and score be plot in Fig . 2 . of the @card@ student who access the video link , @card@ student ( @card@ % ) respond to the first free-text question and @card@ ( @card@ % ) respond to the second question . student learn skill in category that be reflective of those that emerge from the Delphi include : gather information , communication with the patient , triage , available resource , and documentation / communication with other provider ( Table 4 ) . the most common suggestion to improve the video be to include more specific case example during the video or in follow-up material that address common situation ( n = @card@ ) ( Fig . 3 ) . student have differ level of experience prior to the RPCs . some student have little experience , as in “ I’ve never have formal teaching in medical school on how to handle outpatient telephone encounter … ” and , “ I think the big thing be just have a framework for approach to the more remote management of outpatient because it’s not something we routinely get exposure to in medical school . ” another say , “ it be a nice template for a type of patient encounter that we get little-to-no explicit training…during medical school . ” other student have more consequential prior experience . for example , “ …I feel like I learn this in school and be fortunate to have experience practice this during my clerkship a couple of time . ” another student have experience base on their extracurricular activity : “ I actually do feel like I’ve have a lot of practice with manage outpatient remotely in medical school as a result of my work with the Student-Run Free Clinic…I oversee all of the lab that come back for patient , create medical plan , and communicate those to patient . so luckily , I feel like I be already really familiar with the concept in this video . ” in this study , we demonstrate an evidence-informed process by which to develop an educational intervention relate to manage OTCs and prove its efficacy base on a previously validate assessment . we demonstrate that the video be effective in improve student performance respond to simulated OTCs through the level of result accord to the Drs. Kirkpatrick [ @card@ ] . the Delphi technique show utility in establish consensus on a topic without available guideline as an establish way to “ crowdsource ” idea from expert , as have be demonstrate previously in medical education literature [ @card@ , @card@ ] . One particularly relevant example be a study by van Houwelingen et al . who use the Delphi technique to determine entrustable professional activity for nurse in the telehealth setting [ @card@ ] . in our study , the skill deem most important and with high consensus be relate to communication , follow by triage and logistic . this highlight the unique skillset involve in address OTCs beyond just the medical knowledge of outpatient medicine . strength include the variety of specialty represent , and the differ level of experience that include early experienced clinician as well as postgraduate trainee in order to create an educational video inform by different perspective and that would be relevant regardless of student ' intend specialty . our study also have relevance for a scoping review which be currently under protocol by Cooper and Alexander of the Joanna Briggs Institute seek to examine the current evidence on the “ component , skill and training require for conduct initial telephone consultation [ @card@ ] . this scoping review will , reciprocally , put our result in the great context of the current state of medical and allied health professional training . our intervention to improve telephone medicine skill complement those design by other researcher . Seal et al . design a 1-h in-person training session and measure the frequency of gather important information and self-reported student confidence during simulated telephone call . they find that , compare to the control group , student who have complete the training gather important information more frequently and have great self-reported confidence in their performance [ @card@ ] . Saba et al . design a study in which student attend a 2-h in-person training session , follow by telephone call with real patient , and finally a telephone call with a standardized patient . they find that , compare to the control group , student who have complete the program score good on some measure communication skill [ @card@ ] . contrast our intervention with the work of these researcher , the development of a video intervention rather than an in-person lecture be useful as it promote standardization ( i. e. , can be use in the future regardless of lecturer availability or experience ) , flexibility of schedule learning , and repeat viewing if desire . further , while a considerable amount of time be require to initially develop the video , it require no subsequent resource from educator . this also conform with suggestion for provide self-directed learn material [ @card@ ] in response to the trial by Seale et al . [ @card@ ] . while a rapid pivot to remote learning be important ( especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic ) [ 7 , @card@ ] , it be essential to test the efficacy of learn intervention . there be certainly debate regard the utility of randomize controlled trial ( RCTs ) in medical education [ 42–45 ] , but it be generally accept that trial design should reflect the nature of the question and should consider local context [ @card@ , @card@ ] . we choose our trial design base on our ability to perform the study while all student at a single institution be complete their RPCs during the same two-month period , which lessen the problem of different training experience and asynchrony often see in graduate medical education [ @card@ ] . additionally , e-learning such as our video intervention be particularly suitable to RCTs [ @card@ ] in that it standardize the “ teacher ” [ @card@ ] and therefore lead to a relatively simple intervention to improve a relatively narrow problem [ @card@ ] . furthermore , all student have access to the educational video in a timely manner and hence promote a more equitable learning experience . student feedback uncover a significant number of skill that have not be acquire elsewhere in medical school . student recount differ level of exposure to OTCs , which illustrate the need for an educational intervention prior to the start of postgraduate training such as the one create in this study ( or one develop by other researcher [ @card@ , @card@ ] ) . there be a number of limitation to our single center trial . limitation of the Delphi include the number of participant ; the optimum number of participant be 15–30 [ @card@ ] , and the current study have @card@ respondent . further , none of the invite participant from Family Medicine or Pediatrics respond , which may limit generalizability . there be also limitation to the randomize controlled trial . first , there be a relatively small number of participant . second , it be unknown how differ score on mock page case correspond to clinical relevance or how student performance translate to performance during postgraduate training . third , history bias be not controlled ( i. e. , student may have be expose to other lecture regard OTCs during the course of the trial ) ; however , this be mitigate by randomize student within each RPC group . the use of the intention-to-treat analysis lead to include 5 student in the Intervention group who do not view the intervention , 4 of whom have an increase in their score and one of whom have a decrease . this increase the probability of a Type I error ( falsely reject the null hypothesis that our intervention have no effect on student performance ) . finally , our video intervention address general telephone medicine skill , whereas our measurement ( i. e. , the grade rubric ) address the specific skill relevant to each simulated OTC . that be , our intervention do not perfectly match our measurement . this be an intentional decision so as to make our intervention more broadly applicable to outpatient telephone call , while still take advantage of the expert-validated grade rubric that our institution have use for many year . further , the fact that our intervention be not design to improve the specific skill grade on the rubric reduce the probability of a type II error . in conclusion , this study illustrate a process by which to develop an educational intervention address OTCs and demonstrate its efficacy . in the future , we plan to re-record the video base on student feedback and expand the study to a large group of student .   COVID-19 Death and BCG Vaccination Dear Editor , I would like to share idea on the publication “ COVID-19 Death and BCG Vaccination Programs Worldwide ” [ 1 ] . Jirjees et al . [ 1 ] conclude that “ it can be conclude that the early establishment of BCG vaccination policy in any country be a key element in reduce the number of COVID-19 and tuberculosis death case . ” the interrelationship between coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) and tuberculosis be interesting . whether bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) can help prevent the infection and mortality due to COVID-19 be an issue to be further study . from an early report from Indochina , the co-existence between both COVID-19 and tuberculosis be possible [ 2 ] . in that area , Thailand , the BCG be mandatory and more than @card@ % coverage rate be officially declare . however , there be still a problem of COVID-19 infection and death . focus on infected case and death case , it appear that all case have BCG vaccination . there be no association between BCG vaccination history and COVID-19 infection or COVID-19 death . in fact , there be also no identify biological process of BCG that can link to the pathogenesis process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . therefore , it seem that it might not confirm that BCG vaccination can affect the incidence of COVID-19 infection and death .   factor associate with the use and reuse of face mask among Brazilian individual during the COVID-19 pandemic * the COVID-19 pandemic , a disease cause by the novel human coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , have affect people in all continent , with @card@ case confirm up to June 8th , @card@ , along with @card@ deaths(1 ) . Brazil rank third in the world in the number of death ; more than @card@ case and @card@ death be confirm up to the same date in the country(1-2 ) . symptom among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 range from no symptom up to severe case of pulmonary disease . the incubation period that involve the onset of the first symptom may range from two to @card@ day after the infection , though some people do not present any symptoms(3 ) . note that , even if asymptomatic , individual infect with SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to transmit the virus(3-4 ) . Transmission mainly occur from person to person through respiratory droplet , when an individual cough , sneeze or speak near other people , while contaminated surface or object may also be source of transmission(5 ) . therefore , the general population be advise to wear face mask as a mechanical barrier to prevent the dispersion of droplet , in addition to frequent hand sanitization use soap and water or alcohol-based solutions(3 ) . hence , to self-protect against disease and also prevent the transmission of pathogen between healthy and sick individual , mask have be use as a popular public health intervention(6 ) . in Brazil , give a shortage of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , especially surgical mask , the Ministry of Health advise the population , through an informative note publish on April 2nd , @card@ , to make and wear their homemade mask . it also advise that mask make of vacuum bag , cotton , or antimicrobial pillowcase ensure an effective physical barrier , provide they be properly design and sanitized(7 ) . note that to ensure mask be effective for what they be propose , that be , to impede the dissemination of expel droplet , mask need to completely cover mouth and nose and adjust well to the face , without side clearance . homemade mask be recommend to be sanitize before reuse(7 ) . surgical mask be disposable and should not be sanitize because they lose their filter capacity . similarly , N95 respirator should not be wash and the number of time it may be reuse be inform by manufacturers(8 ) . How frequently the population wear mask increase with the onset of local epidemic . it be , however , necessary to well investigate factor such as the duration of protection and how this piece of PPE be use and reuse , consider that inappropriate use , especially of disposable mask , may compromise its protective effect and even raise the risk of infection(9 ) . in this sense , consider that the use of mask be not a common practice in the population in general , in time of pandemic , this measure have be strongly encourage and represent a new reality experience by the Brazilian people . therefore , identify how people have use and reuse this protective piece of equipment be extremely important to discuss the potential effect of not wear the different type of mask or wear them inappropriately in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic . hence , this study’s objective be to identify the factor associate with the use and reuse of mask among Brazilian individual during the COVID-19 pandemic . this cross-sectional study be conduct between April 16th and 27th in the North , Northeast , Southeast , Midwest , and South of Brazil . this study be part of a multinational project address the practice of reuse mask in the population in general during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and be part of an international study “ practice of face mask use among general public during the outbreak of COVID-19 : a multi-country cross-sectional study ” , in partnership with Squina International Centre for Infection Control , Hong Kong Polytechnic University . accord to datum make available by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE ) concern the 4th trimester of @card@ , the population of Brazilian individual age over @card@ year old be approximately @card@ . a representative sample of this population group be use . a finite population sample be calculate with a confidence interval of @card@ % , sample error of 2 % , prevalence of @card@ % , and test power of @card@ % and a minimum sample of @card@ individual be find . the inclusion criterion be be @card@ year old or old , while the exclusion criterion be be a foreign living in Brazil or a health worker . datum be collect through social medium such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Whatsapp , and e-mail . a form compose of two part be apply : @card@ General information ( sex , age , state of residence , educational level , marital status , and contact with individual with respiratory symptom ) ; @card@ information concern the use of mask : type of mask use ( paper mask , fabric mask , surgical mask , active carbon mask , N95 , or other ) , frequency of reuse ( number of time a mask be reuse ) . consider that it be a multinational study , the question be translate from English to Portuguese by two independent translator and be content validate by a panel compose of five expert in the subject . no change be suggest . a pilot test be conduct prior to the datum collection with @card@ individual conveniently select from five different Brazilian region to verify the instrument’s sensitiveness and applicability . only adaptation in term of the form’s online presentation and layout be suggest and implement . the instrument be convert to the online format use Google Forms . invitation to participate in the study be send through message disseminate in social medium , contain a link to the survey . the researcher also publish the link to access the instrument in their social medium profile . by access the link , the Internet user be direct to the Google platform with access to the form . a free and informed consent form be present on the initial page and participant only access the instrument of data collection after provide their consent . the outcome ( dependent ) variable be mask use and surgical mask reuse . the independent variable for both be : sex , age group , educational level , marital status , and contact with people present respiratory symptom . datum be export from Google Forms directly to a spreadsheet in Microsoft Office Excel® and later to IBM® SPSS , version @card@ . descriptive statistical analysis include absolute and relative frequency , to characterize the participant and datum concern the use and reuse of mask , in addition to central tendency ( mean , median , maximum and minimum ) and dispersion measure ( standard deviation ) for age . prevalence concern the use and reuse of mask be estimate consider a confidence interval of @card@ % ( CI @card@ % ) . the Chi-square test\n",
            "be adopt to analyze the association between the outcome and independent variable . association with p<0.20 be verify use binary logistic regression consider the dependent variable be dichotomous , the probability concern the use of face mask and reuse of surgical mask in the population be verify use Odds Ratio ( Or ) and its respective confidence interval of @card@ % . association be consider statistically significant when p<0.05 . the project be submit to and approve by the National Committee of Ethics Research ( Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa - CONEP ) ( CAAE : @card@ ; Opinion @card@ ) . all ethical aspect be comply with in Brazil accord to Resolutions @card@ and @card@ of the National Health Council . financial support : Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico ( CNPq ) , Brazil , grant #401371/2020-4 . in total , @card@ ( @card@ % ) individual participate in the study . regard sociodemographic characteristic , the region with the large number of participant be the southeast with @card@ ( @card@ % ) and Northeast with @card@ ( @card@ % ) , follow by the Midwest with @card@ ( @card@ % ) , North with @card@ ( @card@ % ) , and South with @card@ ( @card@ % ) . most , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be woman , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be marry , age @card@ year old on average ( SD=13.9 ) ; minimum @card@ and maximum @card@ year old . concern the educational level , most participant , @card@ ( @card@ % ) , report hold a college education degree . most , @card@ ( @card@ % ) , report no close contact with individual with respiratory symptom ; @card@ ( @card@ % ) mention at least one contact , @card@ ( @card@ % ) of whom have daily and continuous contact with people present respiratory symptom ( Table 1 ) . most of the participant , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report the use of mask ; only @card@ individual ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report not wear mask . when the frequency be verify per region , the region with the high rate of use be the South with @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , follow by the North with @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , northeast with @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , southeast with @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) and the Midwest with @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) . regard the type of mask use , the most frequently report type be fabric/cotton homemade mask , use exclusively or in combination with other mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , follow by surgical mask , report by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) individual , N95 respirator report by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , paper or gauze report by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , active carbon by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , industrial mask by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , and other type of mask be report by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) participant . note that most of the @card@ ( @card@ % ) individual who report the use of mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) , report wear only one type of mask , follow by @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) who report two type of mask ; @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) individual report three type ; three individual ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report wear four different type of mask ; and two individual ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report five type of mask . the combination of mask most frequently report be fabric/cotton homemade mask in combination with surgical mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) . the variable that present p<0.20 in the association between variable be : sex ( p=0.000 ) , age ( p=0.084 ) , educational level ( p=0.047 ) , and contact with individual present respiratory symptom ( p=0.001 ) ( Table 2 ) . these variable be include in the binary logistic regression model for the outcome variable “ use of mask ” . among the @card@ ( @card@ % ) who report the use of mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report reuse mask , while @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) do not reuse mask . among the @card@ ( @card@ % ) who reuse mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report reuse @card@ time ; @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report mask be use @card@ time ; @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report reuse mask more than 7 time ; and @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) report reuse mask @card@ time ( Table 3 ) . note that most of the @card@ ( @card@ % ) participant who report exclusively wear surgical mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) reuse mask accord to the follow frequency : @card@ ( @card@ % ) rarely/1-2 times reuse mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ) reuse sometimes/3-4 time , @card@ ( @card@ % ) frequently/5-6 time , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) participant reuse always/7 time or more . of those , @card@ ( @card@ % ) who wear only paper or gauze mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) participant reuse accord to the follow frequency : @card@ ( @card@ % ) report use mask rarely/1-2 time ; @card@ ( @card@ % ) sometimes/3-4 time , 8 ( @card@ % ) report always/7 time or more , and 5 participant ( @card@ % ) report reuse mask frequently/5-6 time . among the @card@ ( @card@ % ) who exclusively wear fabric/cotton mask , @card@ ( @card@ % ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ) reuse accord to the follow frequency : @card@ ( @card@ % ) report rarely/1-2 time ; @card@ ( @card@ % ) report always/7 time or more ; @card@ ( @card@ % ) report sometimes/3-4 time , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) report frequently/5-6 time . the confidence interval concern the prevalence of reuse accord to type of mask be present in Table 3 . in the association between variation concern the reuse of surgical mask , sex ( p=0.001 ) be the variable that present p<0.20 and be thus include in the binary logistic regression model for the outcome variable “ reuse of mask ” ( Table 4 ) . after the binary logistic regression , be a woman ( OR=2.02 ; CI @card@ % : @card@ ; p=0.000 ) continue as a factor associate with the more frequent use of mask , present approximately twice the likelihood of wear mask , while have contact with people present respiratory symptom ( OR=1.80 ; CI : @card@ ; p=0.001 ) increase approximately @card@ time the likelihood of wear mask . be a woman ( OR=0.53 ; CI : @card@ ; p=0.001 ) also remain a factor associate with the reuse of surgical mask , though , the reuse of surgical mask be two time less likely among woman than in the population ( Table 5 ) . this study’s finding reveal the pattern of use and reuse of mask in the Brazilian population . virtually all the participant report the use of this piece of PPE and fabric mask be the most frequently report . as the COVID-19 pandemic increasingly aggravate worldwide , the use of mask have be recommend to the population as a non-pharmacological intervention that play a vital role in control the spread of the disease , mainly because the dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 from human to human mainly occur through respiratory droplets(10-11 ) . the recommendation for the population to wear homemade mask during epidemic of respiratory infectious disease such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and COVID-19 , have be successful as a public health intervention at the global level . in China , for instance , this practice have be efficacious in combination with other protective strategy to prevent the dissemination of virus cause these two diseases(12 ) . the population of many country in all the continent have adhere to the use of mask due to the rapid dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 . people in China , include Hong Kong , and Japan , Thailand , and South Korea , have use different type of mask . the growth of case of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic , where the government have make its use mandatory , have be slow than in other European countries(13 ) . on April 2nd , 2020(7 ) , the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommend the population at a national level to start wear mask . the adoption of this recommendation be confirm in a study conduct in the second half of April of the same year , which report that the prevalence of the use of mask be almost absolute in all Brazilian region ; the South present the high prevalence . be a woman double the likelihood of wear mask . One study conduct in China , address @card@ participant during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic , also report great adherence to protective measure among woman , indicate that sex influence adherence to official recommendation relate to health(14 ) . in this study , the likelihood of wear mask almost double among those who have contact with individual with respiratory symptom , which be in agreement with the World Health Organization’s recommendation to those with a confirm diagnosis or suspected infection and their respective caregiver to wear masks(13 ) . One Chinese study , however , verify that this use , regardless of the presence of respiratory symptom , be associate with low level of anxiety and depression , that be , the use of mask have potential psychological benefit , give a sense of safety(15 ) . even though mask promote a sense of safety , despite have contact with asymptomatic individual or those with symptom , the use of mask can be the only measure adopt at the expense of other essential protective measure to prevent COVID-19 . social distancing and hand sanitation with soap and water , or with an antiseptic solution of at least @card@ % alcohol , be highlighted(3 ) . another aspect to take into account be the participant ' educational level , as most report a high education degree , suggest they have a good understanding of the importance of wear mask to prevent the COVID-19 . this finding corroborate with a literature review address the use of mask to prevent respiratory infection , which reveal that high education be positively associate with the practice(16 ) , reinforce the need for educational strategy direct to the entire population , especially those with few year of schooling . regard the type of mask , those make of fabric predominate in this population , emerge as an alternative in the face of a shortage of surgical mask . even though fabric mask be not as effective as those recommend for hospital use , adherence to fabric mask reduce the risk of disseminate respiratory infection . additionally , they be particularly popular in develop country give their availability , low cost , and the possibility to be reuse after washing(17 ) . as current result show , the use of this type of mask among Brazilian individual have be prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic . the reuse of this piece of PPE be a practice mention by a large portion of the individual address in this study . the reuse of mask require attention and should be well discuss with the population adopt this practice . fabric mask need to be wash after be use . the circumstance in which individual consider it necessary to wash mask be not address in this study , but it become apparent that a good portion of the participant reuse mask , at least five time . washing , dry , and stretch gradually increase the porosity of fabric and therefore , impair filtration efficiency , as a study conduct in Nepal shows(17 ) . therefore , investment be need , especially on the part of public policymaker , to provide educational guideline on how to reuse mask to the population in general . the study show that , even though surgical mask be recommend to be discard after use , reuse report be considerably high . surgical mask be disposable and should not be clean or disinfect for late use as they lose their filtration capacity when wet(8 ) . additionally , more than half of the participant who report the exclusive use of surgical mask reuse them more than once , reveal a risky practice that demand the immediate intensification of public intervention , use educational strategy to ensure the correct use of this piece of protective equipment . researcher have test alternative to decontaminate mask , include surgical mask , however , some of these alternative may damage the mask ' block structure through physical or chemical action , or incompletely inactivate pathogen . moreover , these alternative may not be available to the population in general as they require specific instrument or material . additionally , further study be need to assess appropriate measure to decontaminate N95 respirator and surgical masks(18 ) ; study have not report conclusive evidence . therefore , the reuse of surgical mask be not recommend to the population without an effective possibility to safely decontaminate them . in fact , the reuse of surgical mask may even increase the risk of contamination by COVID-19 . another noteworthy finding in this study be the considerable number of people who use , and reuse , paper or gauze mask as respiratory protection , even though , this type of mask have not be recommend in Brazil . another factor be that the reuse of mask be less frequent among woman than among man , reinforce that sex be associate with adherence or lack of adherence to protective practices(14 ) . hence , educational action be necessary to address preventive measure in the context of the COVID-19 among the male population . this study only address the use and reuse of mask in the Brazilian population , however , it be important to stress that mask must be adopt together with other preventive measure . this research draw attention to two concern fact : the inappropriate use of mask and/or the possibility that people become careless with other preventive measure when wear mask . therefore , the set of measure that can decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the pandemic curve , include social distancing , respiratory etiquette , and handwashing , together with the appropriate use of masks(11 ) . these be situation that should be carefully assess by health manager in Brazil to devise more assertive plan and protocol . the current COVID-19 pandemic remain severe worldwide and be an international source of concern , consider that it be a disease with high contagious potential , so the importance of sensitize the population , reinforce control measures(19 ) . this study’s limitation include the fact that digital illiterate be exclude , the impossibility to clarify doubt when participant do not understand a question and lack of knowledge regard the circumstance in which the form be complete . the result show that most of this study’s participant report the use of mask and that fabric mask be more frequently report . be a woman and prior contact with individual with respiratory symptom be associate with the use of mask , increase its likelihood . be a woman be also associate with the reuse of surgical mask though , as woman be twice less likely to reuse this type of mask in the population . this study’s finding draw attention to a risk practice , that of reuse paper and surgical mask , which increase the chance of transmission give inefficacious respiratory protection . in this sense , this study present important contribution in the health field as it provide new scientific evidence regard the use and reuse of mask , which can be use to support the establishment of guideline , public policy and educational strategy to promote the adoption of correct practice to control and prevent the COVID-19 in the Brazilian territory .   this Won’t last Forever : benefit and cost of anticipatory nostalgia people frequently feel nostalgic for their past . but can they feel nostalgic for their present ? What if people become aware in the moment that the present will be miss 1 day in the future ? know that the present will be miss present a unique opportunity to feel nostalgic , as if the present be experience as prematurely past . this paper introduce to the consumer literature the construct of anticipatory nostalgia , which be define as miss aspect of the present before they be go . whereas personal nostalgia be a longing for what have already be lose , anticipatory nostalgia involve a longing for what have not yet be lose ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . at one time or another , likely more so in momentous life experience ( e. g. , graduation , holiday , anniversary ) , people can be strike by feeling of anticipatory nostalgia , as exemplify by the word of singer Trace Adkins , “ you may not know it now , but you’re gonna miss this”(Gorley and Miller , @card@ ) . people may also initiate anticipatory nostalgia on tough day ( e. g. , care for ill relative , breakup in a relationship ) so that they can make the present moment easy to live with . when the whole world be struggle with the @card@ epidemic , we find a blog title “ COVID-19 lockdown nostalgia : it be a scary time , but I will miss our enforce family togetherness ” ( Dietitian Farida , @card@ ) . What be the consequence of bring nostalgia into the present ? Will anticipatory nostalgia sweeten the present with the soft glow of reminiscence ? or will it dilute the present enjoyment by consider it already go ? this paper aim to investigate whether anticipatory nostalgia elevate or impoverish consumer experience . our finding provide relevant insight into how to enhance consumer experience . What can company do to help consumer extract the great happiness from an experience ? while exist research provide little guidance about how to maximize consumer enjoyment from an experience , company sometimes use promotion communication that can trigger anticipatory nostalgia . for example , Kodak ad include the message “ life’s little moment don’t stay forever ” and “ don’t cry over miss special moment . ” Disney use the taglines “ let the memory begin ” and “ unforgettable happen here . ” an ad about global warming warn “ winter , you will miss it when it’s go . ” these marketing communication can elicit anticipatory nostalgia . but how can this affect consumer experience ? Will we live good or bad as a result of such message ? although specific definition of nostalgia vary , personal nostalgia be commonly understand to denote currently miss aspect of one’s live past ( Batcho , @card@ , 2013a ) . definition of nostalgia as “ a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past ” ( Sedikides et al . , 2015a , page @card@ ; Sedikides et al . , 2015b , page @card@ ) and as “ miss or long for something in the past ” ( Batcho , @card@ ) share the common element of longing for the past . definition that include the component of affection for the past often qualify it with descriptor such as “ wistful , ” that be , “ characterize by melancholy , longing or yearning . ” both theoretical approach conceptualize personal nostalgia as a blend bittersweet emotion . in prior research base upon the two definition , personal nostalgia have be associate with a number of psychological benefit , include enhanced consumer patience ( Huang et al . , @card@ ) , social connectedness ( Werman , @card@ ; Batcho , @card@ ; Wildschut et al . , @card@ , @card@ ; Zhou et al . , @card@ ) , social competence and relationship satisfaction ( Juhl et al . , @card@ ) , continuity of self ( Iyer and Jetten , @card@ ; Sedikides et al . , 2015a ) , identity exploration ( Batcho et al . , @card@ ) , self-esteem ( Vess et al . , @card@ ; Cheung et al . , @card@ ) , meaningfulness ( Sedikides et al . , @card@ ; Batcho , @card@ ; Routledge et al . , @card@ ) , and social-emotional cope , goal-directed strategy , and positive reframing ( Batcho , 2013b ) . although nostalgia be believe to be universal , research suggest that its benefit might vary as a function of trait such as neuroticism , neuro-excitability for sadness , and narcissism ( Barrett et al . , @card@ ; Köneke , @card@ ; Hart et al . , @card@ ) , as well as habitual worrying ( Verplanken , @card@ ) , the belief in identity continuity ( Iyer and Jetten , @card@ ) , or social support ( Wildschut et al . , @card@ ) . another recent approach have raise the possibility that the impact of nostalgia might depend upon the time perspective govern the emotion . What if aspect of the present be miss as if they be already past ? Recent research have introduce the construct of anticipatory nostalgia , in reference to a tendency to miss element of the present before they be past by imagine them from a future vantage point ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . anticipatory nostalgia , define as miss the present prematurely before it have become past , have be distinguish from personal nostalgia , which be a psychological state of miss and long for what have already be lose ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ; Batcho , @card@ ) . although correlate , anticipatory and personal nostalgia be find to constitute separate type of nostalgia . whereas personal nostalgia be associate with remember the past , positive affect , and favorable reaction , anticipatory nostalgia be align with think of the future , emotional distancing , difficulty enjoy the present , and a great tendency to sadness and worry ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . by definition , when anticipatory nostalgia be prime , an imagine future may create a conflict between an actual present and a hypothetical future . with the “ someday past ” still present , anticipatory nostalgia be contingent upon first mentally create the condition that give rise to the missing element(s ) . Cognitively complex , anticipatory nostalgia involve the experience of the present , an imagine future , and an imagine future past ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ; Batcho , @card@ ) . anticipatory nostalgia should not be confuse with anticipated nostalgia . anticipated nostalgia be the prediction or expectation that one will feel nostalgic for an aspect of the present in the future , not feel nostalgic in the present ( Cheung et al . , @card@ ) . predict future nostalgia be an interesting cognitive process but not identical to the emotional phenomenon of feel nostalgic before the future loss occur . a person can expect to miss a love one when they leave or die someday , but the expectation doesn’t necessarily include the emotional component of nostalgic miss . expect future nostalgia have be show to predict nostalgia after an important life transition and to be associate with great savor of the experience . Post-transition nostalgia be associate with benefit , include enhanced self-esteem , social connectedness , and mean in life ( Cheung et al . , @card@ ) . the finding of a great likelihood of expect future nostalgia for more positive experience be not surprising . people would be more likely to expect to miss enjoyable or meaningful event . the line of research by Cheung et al . ( @card@ ) report positive outcome of future oriented nostalgia have identify benefit of expect to be nostalgic in the future , rather than be nostalgic for what have not yet be lose . To date , anticipatory nostalgia have be assess and explore as a dispositional trait . Research suggest that people prone to anticipatory nostalgia be more likely to experience difficulty enjoy the present and have a great tendency to worry ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . it be not yet know whether such difficulty characterize anticipatory nostalgia experience as a pass mood state . do know that the present will be miss 1 day help us appreciate it more deeply or perceive it as more meaningful ? or do it rob the present of pleasure by consider it already go ? do envision its future loss also decrease enjoyment of the present by generate anxiety about an uncertain future ? What impact do an individual’s activation of anticipatory nostalgia have on their current experience ? on this issue , exist research have not reach a clear conclusion . Batcho and Shikh ( @card@ ) find that positive Panas intensity be not relate to dispositional anticipatory nostalgia ; however , negative Panas intensity be significantly positively relate to dispositional anticipatory nostalgia . meanwhile , regression analysis after add personal nostalgia trait and other social personality trait find that anticipatory nostalgia predict sadness and worry . although it appear that anticipatory nostalgia be more associate with negativity , Batcho and Shikh ( @card@ ) also find that people in negative situation ( compare to positive situation ) show a strong tendency to view the present from a future perspective , which be characteristic of anticipatory nostalgia , suggest that anticipatory nostalgia be likely a response to negative situation and that activate anticipatory nostalgia may mitigate negative emotion in a situation . however , the positive or negative effect that activate anticipatory nostalgia can have on an individual’s emotion , and the condition under which the effect arise , have not be clearly establish in previous research . Batcho and Shikh ( @card@ , page @card@ ) have make a conjecture base on reasoning that the effect of anticipatory nostalgia may vary depend on the valence of emotional state of the present , but they do not collect empirical evidence to test it . the main basis for their reasoning be that anticipatory nostalgia encompass both a present experience and a future time perspective , which lead to a conflict between a real present and an imagine future ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . the existence of this temporal perspective difference be consistent with their finding ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . the present study be specifically concern with whether the consequence of this perspective difference will vary depend on the current contextual valence of the situation . on the one hand , anticipatory nostalgia may hurt consumer experience , as it entail a conflict between an actual present and an imagine future ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . imagine an abstract future might generate anxiety associate with uncertainty and worry about the ability to cope with loss and change . Research have show that consumer who make prediction about uncertain event enjoy observe those event significantly less than those who do not make prediction ( Mandel and Nowlis , @card@ ) . consider uncertain outcome can decrease enjoyment by produce anticipated regret , and enjoyment be decrease to the extent that outcome be perceive as more uncertain . anticipatory nostalgia would be expect to decrease enjoyment by make salient the future uncertainty . moreover , anticipatory nostalgia may decrease enjoyment by interfere with live fully in the moment . envision the present from a future perspective might prevent one from be mindful of the present and savor the moment . mindfulness be a state of bring one’s attention to experience occur in the present moment , during which one be fully aware of what be take place and immerse in the present ( Brown and Ryan , @card@ ) . mindfulness practice be effective in enhance life satisfaction , decrease mood disturbance , and reduce stress and anxiety ( Barnes et al . , @card@ ; Querstret and Cropley , @card@ ; Gu et al . , @card@ ) . Research have also identify high involvement or total absorption in an activity to be an important determinant of the subjective experience of leisure ( Unger and Kernan , @card@ ) . because be mindful of the present reduce anxiety and enhance experience , anticipatory nostalgia can diminish the pleasure of an experience by reduce mindfulness and provoking anxiety . on the other hand , anticipatory nostalgia may enhance consumer experience by make consumer feel that the present be fleeting , thus increase the perceive value of the present . One study show that college senior appreciate their college experience more when they be lead to see that they have little time ( vs. lot of time ) leave to enjoy it ( Kurtz , @card@ ) . young people report great happiness for extraordinary experience than ordinary one , whereas happiness from ordinary experience increase as people get old and perceive their future as less extensive . such finding suggest that happiness be more intense when an experience be perceive as unlikely to reoccur ( Bhattacharjee and Mogilner , @card@ ) . Research have also show that savor a nostalgic experience by try to prolong it can increase consumer patience ( Huang et al . , @card@ ) . consumer face uncertainty connect to a positive event can experience great , longer-lasting positive feeling when they imagine possible favorable outcome ( Lee and Qiu , @card@ ) . build on this line of research , we predict that anticipatory nostalgia may enhance experience by make them more valuable in the moment . To summarize , previous research and theory seem to suggest that by bring the future into the present , anticipatory nostalgia can either enhance or diminish consumer experience of the present . draw together these and other diverse line of evidence show that both type of effect be possible , we consider the determinant and postulate that the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on consumer experience be dependent on a contextual factor : experience valence . on the one hand , bring the future into a positive present may hurt the experience . To enjoy a positive experience to its full , one need to be immerse in it and pay full attention to it . thus , during a positive experience , think of the imminent future that be full of uncertainty will provoke anxiety , which will in turn reduce enjoyment of the experience . however , if the experience be negative , shift attention to the future might remind people that the present be valuable in spite of its difficulty and allow for benefit such as appreciation and reappraisal of the present . cognitive reappraisal be a positive coping strategy that can reduce stress and anxiety during negative event ( Kivity et al . , @card@ ) . therefore , bring the future into the negative present can prevent ruminate on negative aspect and reduce anxiety , which in turn enhance consumer experience . we put forth the follow set of hypothesis : we have three particular aim with the current research . first , we aim to test whether anticipatory nostalgia can reduce people’s enjoyment of an experience ( H1.1 ) . our second aim be to examine the potential for anticipatory nostalgia to harm the enjoyment of an experience , depend on the valence of experience ( H1.1 and H2.1 ) . our third aim be to examine the possible mechanism of anticipatory nostalgia’s influence on enjoyment of an experience ( H1.2 and H2.2 ) . in order to identify the benefit or disadvantage of anticipatory nostalgia , an assessment method be need to launch empirical investigation of its function and correlate . although the survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia have show promise as a measure , it serve to assess dispositional anticipatory nostalgia ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . the present research introduce a transient state measure of anticipatory nostalgia to examine dynamics underlie the impact of premature nostalgia for the present before it become the past . the pilot study verify the internal reliability of the measurement of transient state measure of anticipatory nostalgia and distinguish it from the measurement of state personal nostalgia . by use the transient state measure for anticipatory nostalgia , 4 study be conduct in the present research . in study 1 we ask individual to imagine a trip to Disneyland and manipulate anticipatory nostalgia with an advertising slogan . a sample of @card@ university student participate in an imaginary trip to Disneyland . we examine the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on consumer enjoyment ( H1.1 ) . in study 2 we ask participant to imagine celebrate their birthday , and anticipatory nostalgia be manipulate with a camera advertisement . we study the effect of nostalgia on consumer enjoyment , and the possible mechanism underlie the effect ( H1.1 and H1.2 ) . in study 3 we introduce experience valence as a moderate variable to look at how diverge effect of anticipatory nostalgia can emerge in experience with different valence ( H1.1 , H1.2 , H2.1 , and H2.2 ) . Study 4 extend the paradigm to a real-life setting and assess the impact of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment and meaningfulness 8 h after the manipulation as a function of life satisfaction . participant be @card@ student at a large public university range in age from @card@ to @card@ year ( @card@ % female ; Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ ) . student receive a small monetary stipend for their participation . they be randomly assign to either the anticipatory-nostalgia condition or the control condition . a four-item self-report measure of state anticipatory nostalgia be construct , guide by the content in the dispositional survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) . the item focus on participant ' nostalgia for anticipated future loss of aspect of the present : “ right now , I know that the present will be miss some day , ” “ in the future , I will get nostalgic about aspect of my life now , ” “ in the future , I will often think about thing that be happen right now , ” and “ I expect that I will miss my current lifestyle . ” To ensure that the item assess anticipatory nostalgia as a state , respondent be instruct : “ please rate the follow item base on how you feel right now . ” agreement with each of the four statement be indicate on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ strongly disagree , ” 7 = “ strongly agree ” ) . To confirm the reliability of the measure of anticipatory nostalgia and its relationship with personal nostalgia , we recruit a sample of @card@ United States participant through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ) marketplace for the payment of @card@ USD . Three respondent fail the attention-check task , result in a final sample of @card@ adult range in age from @card@ to @card@ year ( Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ , @card@ % male ) . besides the state measure of anticipatory nostalgia , respondent also complete state measure of personal nostalgia ( Wildschut et al . , @card@ ) and self-continuity ( Sedikides et al . , 2015a ) , and dispositional measure of construal level ( Vallacher and Wegner , @card@ ) , self-esteem ( Rosenberg , @card@ ) , sense of power , arousal seek ( Goukens et al . , @card@ ) , and socioeconomic status ( SES ) . the descriptive statistic for the four anticipatory nostalgia item be display in Table 1 . principal component factor analysis of this scale yield a one-factor solution ( base on examination of the scree plot as well as Kaiser’s rule that only factor with eigenvalue great than 1 be extract ) . the eigenvalue for factor 1 be @card@ . this single unobserved factor account for @card@ % of the variance in the four item . the four item be average to form a composite measure to delineate the sample characteristic confound effect ( Wainer , @card@ ; Dawes , @card@ ) . the correlation between item combine use factor weight and item combine use unit weight be r = @card@ . the coefficient for the composite measure be @card@ . One-factor solution be obtain for female and male participant . further , principal component factor analysis of anticipatory nostalgia and personal nostalgia scale yield a two-factor solution ( base on examination of the scree plot as well as Kaiser’s rule that only factor with eigenvalue great than 1 be extract ) . the eigenvalue for factor 1 be @card@ , and for factor 2 the eigenvalue be @card@ . the first unobserved factor account for @card@ % of the variance , and the second factor account for @card@ % of the variance . the rotate component matrix demonstrate that anticipatory nostalgia load on the first factor , and personal nostalgia load on the second factor ( Table 2 ) . this analysis show that the state measure of anticipatory nostalgia be a construct distinct from personal nostalgia . consistent with exist research on personal nostalgia , we find that anticipatory nostalgia be not correlate significantly with gender or SES ( Anderson et al . , 2012b ) . as expect , the new measure of anticipatory nostalgia correlate positively with measure of personal nostalgia and self-continuity ( Table 3 ) . also consistent with prediction , our result show that self-esteem , arousal seek , and sense of power be not correlate with anticipatory nostalgia . contextual effect could account for the absence of a correlation between the transient measure of anticipatory nostalgia and the dispositional measure of construal level . in general , anticipation might encourage more abstract construal ( Vallacher and Wegner , @card@ ) , result in great psychological distance from the present . however , construal level might depend upon context , with abstract construal more attractive in pleasant situation than in unpleasant one ( Labroo and Patrick , @card@ ) . in summary , the four-item , self-report anticipatory nostalgia survey prove to be a coherent , internally consistent measure . study 1 examine whether marketing communication promote an experience can elicit anticipatory nostalgia , and we test the effect of such communication on consumer enjoyment , as state in hypothesis 1 . all participant be instruct to imagine that they go to Disneyland for a weekend . they be ask to imagine the specific activity they be do there and how much fun they be have . participant work at their own pace , with no time constraint . follow the imagination exercise , participant be present with one of two version of an advertisement for Walt Disney World Resort Annual Passholder webpage ( see figure on https : //thedisneyblog . com/2011/09/15/disney-world-annual-pass-advertisement/ ) . the original slogan on the advertisement be remove , and participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition see an advertisement with the slogan “ you will miss this moment when it’s go . ” those in the control condition see the same advertisement without the slogan . participant imagine that they see this advertisement when they be in Disneyland . they be ask to evaluate the ad for attractiveness and beauty on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ not at all , ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . next , participant be ask to evaluate their imaginary Disneyland experience by rating how much they enjoy themselves , how happy they be , how much fun they have , and how involved they be on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ not at all ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . these item be adapt from previous research measure of consumer enjoyment ( Nowlis et al . , @card@ ; Mandel and Nowlis , @card@ ; Miller et al . , @card@ ) . the average rating for the four item comprise a composite score of enjoyment ( α = @card@ ) . participant then complete a measure of their current affect , the positive and negative Affect Schedule ( Panas ; Watson et al . , @card@ ) . the Panas consist of @card@ item assess positive affect ( Pa ) with descriptor such as “ interested ” and “ enthusiastic ” ( α = @card@ ) and @card@ item assess negative affect ( Na ) with descriptor such as “ distressed ” and “ upset ” ( α = @card@ ) . item be rate on a 5-point scale ( 1 = “ very slightly or not at all , ” 5 = “ extremely ” ) . finally , participant complete the transient state anticipatory nostalgia measure develop in the pilot study , with response average to yield a composite index of state anticipatory nostalgia ( α = @card@ ) , follow by the three manipulation-check item for state personal nostalgia ( Wildschut et al . , @card@ ) . response to the three item be average to provide an index of personal nostalgia ( α = @card@ ) . participant also report their age and gender . To confirm that the manipulation of anticipatory nostalgia be successful , average anticipatory-nostalgia score be analyze in an independent t-test . confirm that the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation be effective , participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition report feel more anticipatory nostalgia ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do their counterpart in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = −3.37 , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . To confirm that the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation do not influence the level of personal nostalgia , participant ' self-reported nostalgia score be analyze in an independent t-test . as expect , personal-nostalgia score for the anticipatory condition ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) do not differ from those for the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] , suggest that the manipulation do not affect personal nostalgia . meanwhile , the correlation coefficient of anticipatory and personal nostalgia be non-significant , r(120 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ . rating of attractiveness , t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ , and beauty , t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ , of the advertisement do not differ between the two group , suggest that ad attractiveness be not the drive force behind the main finding . the average rating of enjoyment ( α = @card@ ) be analyze in an independent t-test . consistent with our prediction , participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition feel less enjoyment ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . exposure to an advertisement that elicit anticipatory nostalgia reduce participant ' enjoyment of the experience . consistent with this result , participant ' enjoyment level be negatively correlate with their anticipatory-nostalgia score [ r ( @card@ ) = −0.248 , p = @card@ ] . the more anticipatory nostalgia participant feel , the less enjoyment they tend to have . the researcher further examine positive ( α = @card@ ) and negative ( α = @card@ ) emotion on the Panas scale . the result be consistent with the hypothesis of a decrease in enjoyment , with less positive emotion ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) expect in the anticipatory nostalgic group than in the control group [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , Cohen’s d = @card@ ] , and high negative emotion in the nostalgia group ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than those in the control group [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = −3.10 , p = @card@ , Cohen‘s d = @card@ ] . To conclude , the subject who be prime for anticipatory nostalgia ( compare to the control group ) in the positive situation feel less positive emotion and more negative emotion . the result of the Panas analysis be consistent with the finding on enjoyment . contrary to theory that posit a favorable impact of anticipation ( Mandel and Nowlis , @card@ ) , exposure to an advertisement with an anticipatory-nostalgia slogan intend to enhance consumer ' experience decrease enjoyment and general positive affect . consistent with hypothesis @card@ , the present result support the unfavorable impact of anticipated nostalgia . however , study 1 leave several question unanswered . What force drive the reduce enjoyment and positive affect ? Can the result be generalize to other trigger of anticipatory nostalgia and other context ? study 2 address these question . participant be @card@ student at a large public university who volunteer in exchange for a small monetary payment ( @card@ % female ; Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ ) . they be randomly assign to either the anticipatory-nostalgia condition or the control condition . all participant first be ask to imagine that it be their birthday and that they be have a party to celebrate . they be ask to imagine how happy they be at the party , and in detail the specific activity they be engage in at the party . participant work at their own pace , with no time constraint . participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition be then ask to imagine that they see a camera advertisement on TV with the message , “ capture this moment , because you will miss it soon . ” they be instruct to imagine the feeling this advertisement stir in them . those in the control condition be prompt to imagine that they see a camera advertisement and be ask to relate the feeling this ad stir in them . all participant then rate how much they would enjoy their birthday party on the same four item use in study 1 . participant also rate their current emotion on the Panas as in study 1 . next , participant rate their anxiety level on four item ( Marteau and Bekker , @card@ ) : “ right now I feel anxious , ” “ I feel nervous , ” “ I be nervous , ” and “ right now I can calm myself down . ” participant indicate their level of agreement with each of these four statement on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ strongly disagree , ” 7 = “ strongly agree ” ) . rating be average across the four item to serve as a composite score of anxiety ( α = @card@ ) . finally , participant complete the manipulation-check item for transient state anticipatory and personal nostalgia as in study 1 and report their gender and age . as in study 1 , a composite measure of transient state anticipatory nostalgia be obtain by average the four item ( α = @card@ ) . confirm the effectiveness of the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation , an independent t-test indicate that participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition feel more anticipatory nostalgia ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . moreover , the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation do not influence the level of personal nostalgia [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] , even though personal and anticipatory nostalgia be positively correlate , r = @card@ , p = @card@ . as in study 1 , we average the four rating of enjoyment ( α = @card@ ) . consistent with our prediction , an independent t-test reveal that participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition feel less enjoyment ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ , t(118 ) = −2.33 , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . again , we find that the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation reduce participant ' enjoyment . furthermore , participant ' enjoyment level be negatively correlate with their anticipatory-nostalgia score [ r ( @card@ ) = −0.313 , p < @card@ ] . the more anticipatory nostalgia participant feel , the less enjoyment they tend to have . hypothesis @card@ be validate again . the researcher further examine positive ( α = @card@ ) and negative ( α = @card@ ) emotion on the Panas scale . participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition feel low level of positive affect ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = −4.42 , p < @card@ , d = @card@ ] , and high level of negative affect ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; t(118 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , Cohen’s d = @card@ ] . these result be consistent with those in study 1 , and with the finding on enjoyment . To test whether anxiety ( α = @card@ ) mediate the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment , we conduct a simple mediation analysis use @card@ bias-corrected bootstrap sample with Model 4 of the Process plug-in ( Zhao et al . , @card@ ; Hayes , @card@ ) . the result reveal a significant positive effect of anticipatory nostalgia ( manipulation condition variable , control = 0 , anticipatory nostalgia = 1 ) on anxiety ( b = @card@ , Se = @card@ , p < @card@ , @card@ % CI [ @card@ ; @card@ ] ) and a significant negative effect of anxiety on enjoyment ( b = −0.26 , Se = @card@ , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.45 , −0.08 ] ) . when anxiety be simultaneously examine as a potential mediator for the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment , anticipatory nostalgia be no longer significant ( b = −0.36 , Se = @card@ , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.86 , @card@ ] ) . more importantly , the indirect effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment via anxiety be significant ( b = −0.21 , Se = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.51 , −0.06 ] ) . thus , we find that anticipatory nostalgia enhanced anxiety , which in turn significantly decrease enjoyment . consistent with our prediction , anxiety completely mediate the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment ( see Figure 1 ) . thus , Hypothesis @card@ be validate . study 2 make two contribution , the first of which concern clarification of the mechanism underlie the effect of anticipatory nostalgia . although company readily appeal to anticipatory nostalgia in ad intend to enhance consumer experience , they inadvertently can make consumer more anxious , undermine consumer enjoyment and general positive affect . second , study 2 replicate and extend study 1’s finding employ a different manipulation of anticipatory nostalgia and utilize a different type of experience . Study 2 show that the effect of anticipatory nostalgia be not merely the by-product of a give manipulation or a give experience . we recruit @card@ student ( @card@ man and @card@ woman ) from a major public university to participate in the experiment in exchange for a small monetary stipend ; they range in age from @card@ to @card@ year ( Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ ) . anticipatory nostalgia and affective valence of the experience be manipulate in a 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia or control ) × 2 ( positive or negative experience ) between-subjects design . all participant be ask to imagine they be in Disneyland . similar to study 1 , those in the positive-experience condition be ask to imagine they be have a great time and to visualize in detail what kind of activity they be do and who they be with . those in the negative-experience condition be ask to imagine they be have a terrible time in Disneyland . the weather be lousy and the line be long . they be also ask to imagine in detail what kind of activity they be do and who they be with . participant work at their own pace , with no time constraint . participant be then present with one of the two ad use in study 1 to manipulate their sense of anticipatory nostalgia . they be ask to evaluate the ad for attractiveness and beauty on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ not at all , ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . participant next rate their enjoyment and their emotion on the Panas as in study 1 and 2 , follow by rate their anxiety level accord to the four item use in study 2 . finally , participant complete the manipulation-check item for anticipatory and personal nostalgia and report their gender and age . composite rating of anticipatory nostalgia average over the four item ( α = @card@ ) be analyze in a 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia or control ) × 2 ( positive or negative experience ) between-subjects design . a significant main effect of the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation confirm that participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition feel more anticipatory nostalgia ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control condition [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ ] . there be a significant main effect of experience valence [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . respondent in the positive experience group ( Mpositive experience = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) report more anticipatory nostalgia than those in the negative experience group ( Mnegative experience = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) . however , the interaction effect of the two factor on anticipatory nostalgia be non-significant [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 < @card@ ] . moreover , as in study 1 and 2 , the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation do not influence the level of personal nostalgia [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ ] , even though personal and anticipatory nostalgia be positively correlate , r = @card@ , p = @card@ . neither the main effect of experience valence [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ ] nor the interaction [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 < @card@ ] be significant . meanwhile , neither the attractiveness of the advertisement , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ , nor rating of its beauty , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ , differ between the anticipatory nostalgia and control group , suggest that the impact of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment and affect be not drive by aesthetic difference between the ad . a 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia or control ) × 2 ( positive or negative experience ) ANOVA on rating of enjoyment reveal a significant main effect of experience valence on enjoyment , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , η2 = @card@ . participant in the positive-experience group indicate more enjoyment ( Mpositive = @card@ , SDpositive = @card@ ) than do those in the negative group ( Mnegative = @card@ , SDnegative = @card@ ) . the main effect of the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation on enjoyment be not significant , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 < @card@ ( Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ) . more interesting , however , be the significant interaction of the two factor , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , η2 = @card@ . confirm our hypothesis , planned comparison reveal a simple effect of anticipatory nostalgia in the positive- and negative-experience condition , but in opposite direction . specifically , in the positive-experience condition , anticipatory nostalgia reduce enjoyment [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] ; whereas in the negative-experience condition , anticipatory nostalgia increase enjoyment [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . thus , hypothesis @card@ and @card@ be validate again . use Panas positive emotion as the dependent variable , a 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia group vs. control group ) × 2 ( positive vs. negative experience ) ANOVA indicate that the manipulation of anticipatory nostalgia reduce positive emotion in the positive situation but elevated positive emotion in the negative situation . there be a significant main effect of experience type [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . respondent in the positive experience group ( Mpositive experience = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) report more positive emotion than those in the negative experience group ( Mnegative experience = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) . the main effect of anticipatory nostalgia on positive emotion be not significant ( Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ;

            "@card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 < @card@ ) . a significant interaction effect be expect between nostalgia and experience type [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . further simple effect test reveal that , for positive experience , the anticipatory nostalgia manipulation reduce positive emotion [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] ; however , for negative experience , anticipatory nostalgia increase positive emotion [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . similarly , the negative emotion of Panas be use as the dependent variable to again verify the finding obtain in study 2 . the result of the 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia group vs. control group ) × 2 ( positive vs. negative experience ) ANOVA indicate that the manipulation of anticipatory nostalgia increase the negative emotion of the subject in the positive situation , but decrease the negative emotion of the subject in the negative situation . there be a significant main effect of experience type [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] , and subject in the positive experience group ( Mpositive = @card@ , SDpositive = @card@ ) report few negative emotion than the negative experience group do ( Mnegative = @card@ , SDnegative = @card@ ) . the main effect of anticipatory nostalgia on negative emotion be not significant [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F ( @card@ ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . in contrast , there be a significant interaction effect between anticipatory nostalgia and experience type [ F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . further simple effect test reveal that , for positive experience , the anticipatory nostalgia manipulation increase negative emotion [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] ; for negative experience , the anticipatory nostalgia manipulation reduce negative emotion [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . these result show the same pattern as those in study 1 and study 2 , and be also consistent with the finding on enjoyment . a 2 ( anticipatory nostalgia or control ) × 2 ( positive or negative experience ) ANOVA on anxiety score yield non-significant main effect of anticipatory-nostalgia condition [ Fanticipatory nostalgia ( @card@ ) = @card@ , p = @card@ ] and experience valence [ Fvalence ( @card@ ) = @card@ , p = @card@ ] . importantly , the interaction between anticipatory nostalgia and experience valence be significant , F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , η2 = @card@ ( Figure 2 ) . here again , anticipatory nostalgia produce directionally different effect for those with positive experience and those with negative experience . specifically , in the positive-experience condition , anticipatory nostalgia increase anxiety [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] , whereas in the negative-experience condition , anticipatory nostalgia reduce anxiety [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; F(1,196 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ , partial η2 = @card@ ] . To investigate the moderate effect of valence of experience on the mediation effect of anxiety on the influence of anticipatory nostalgia ( manipulation condition variable , control = 0 , anticipatory nostalgia = 1 ) on enjoyment , a bootstrap moderate mediation analysis with @card@ bootstrap sample be perform ( Model 7 , Zhao et al . , @card@ ; Hayes , @card@ ) . we find significant moderate mediation effect of valence of experience ( manipulation condition variable , negative = 0 , positive = 1 ) on the mediation effect of anxiety ( b = −0.85 , Se = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −1.33 , −0.46 ] ) . in the negative-valence experience condition , the indirect path from anticipatory nostalgia to enjoyment be significantly positive ( b = @card@ , Se = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ @card@ , @card@ ] ) , whereas in the positive-valence experience condition , the indirect path be significantly negative ( b = −0.38 , Se = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.67 , −0.15 ] ; figure 3 ) . when anxiety rating be simultaneously examine as potential mediator for the effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment , the effect of anticipatory nostalgia be no longer significant ( b = @card@ , Se = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.40 , @card@ ] ) . thus , hypothesis @card@ and @card@ be validate again . as in study 1 and 2 , we again find that anticipatory nostalgia reduce enjoyment and general positive affect in the positive-experience condition . however , study 3 reveal that this effect can be reverse when the experience be negative . follow-up analysis confirm that this interaction be mediate by anxiety . that be , anticipatory nostalgia increase anxiety in a positive experience , which in turn reduce enjoyment and decrease positive affect . on the other hand , anticipatory nostalgia reduce anxiety in a negative experience , which in turn enhance enjoyment and boost positive affect . we pretested two version of campus postcard in order to ensure the validity of anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation . in study 4 . @card@ student ( range in age from @card@ to @card@ ) be recruit online ( @card@ woman , @card@ man ; Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ ) and randomly assign to either the anticipatory-nostalgia condition or control condition . the two group be both instruct to go through 6 postcard , read the copy on them , and then choose the one they like good . participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia condition see a set of six campus image with the slogan “ Someday , you will miss people and thing here . ” on each , while those in the control condition see another set of postcard with the same image but a different slogan “ on this beautiful campus , you be surround by friendly people . ” All the six postcard be present to the participant in random order . they be require to click the button under the postcard they like the good . only one postcard could be choose . after that , participant complete the manipulation-check item for anticipatory ( α = @card@ ) and personal nostalgia ( α = @card@ ) , rate their anxiety level ( α = @card@ ) on the same measure use in study 1 , 2 , and 3 , and report their gender and age . result reveal that the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation do influence the level of anticipatory nostalgia [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; t(106 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] , and have no effect on personal nostalgia [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; t(106 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . participant ' anxiety do not differ between the two group [ Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SDanticipatory nostalgia = @card@ ; Mcontrol = @card@ , SDcontrol = @card@ ; t(106 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , d = @card@ ] . the pretest confirm the sufficient manipulation validity of the campus postcard we would use in study 4 . participant be @card@ university student invite to give their opinion in an activity sponsor by the alumnus association . Eight hour after the session , at about @card@ page m. , participant be contact for follow-up . by the end of the day , we fail to get in touch with @card@ of them to participate in the second part of the study , leave a final sample of @card@ participant ( @card@ % female ; Mage = @card@ , SDage = @card@ ) . there be no significant difference in gender , F(1,300 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , or age , F(1,300 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , between the people we fail to contact and those in the final sample . participant be recruit on campus around noon ( @card@ a. m. to @card@ page m. ) to participate in an activity to help the university select its future official image . as an indicator of how positive or negative they perceive their present to be , participant be first ask to rate their current life satisfaction by respond to the question “ right now , how much be you satisfy with your present life ? ” on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ not at all , ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . next , participant be present with six different image of the campus and ask to vote for the one they like good . the student be randomly assign to either an anticipatory-nostalgia condition or a control condition . we manipulate participant ' anticipatory nostalgia with the material pretested . specifically , for the anticipatory-nostalgia group , the caption read : “ Someday , you will miss people and thing here . ” for the control group , the caption read : “ on this beautiful campus , you be surround by friendly people . ” participant be ask to evaluate each of the six image carefully and to vote for the one they like good . after voting , participant be ask to read the caption and evaluate its fluency ( “ How fluent do you think this sentence be ? ” 1 = “ not at all , ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . at the end of the first session , participant leave their cell phone number in order to be contact and tell which image win the popular vote by the end of the day . the purpose of the experiment be not to determine the duration of the effect , so we do not schedule multiple survey after noon . we be more concern with meet the requirement of the experiment while not disrupt the normal campus life of the student . we conduct the second round of interview around @card@ page m. for a number of reason : first , the school’s study room and library close at @card@ , and most student have already return to their dormitory at @card@ , so be interview do not interfere with their study ; second , this time represent the end of the day , make it convenient for us to ask the subject to evaluate their feeling about the day . thirdly , the interviewer have to contact the interviewee one by one for the 2nd part of survey . it take about an hour to make all the call , and we want to finish the call before midnight . thus , after about 8 h , participant be contact and ask to indicate the extent to which they enjoy themselves that day and to what extent they feel they have a meaningful day on a 7-point scale ( 1 = “ not at all , ” 7 = “ very much ” ) . participant be then inform of the image election result , and those who have select the most popular image receive a small monetary reward . finally , they report their gender and age . ANOVA analysis indicate a non-significant main effect of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment of the day ( Mcontrol = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; Manticipatory nostalgia = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,263 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . participant ' rating of their life satisfaction before the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation be test as a possible moderator variable . we investigate whether the two interact to influence enjoyment report at the end of the day . first , regression analysis utilize manipulation condition variable ( control = 0 , anticipatory nostalgia = 1 ) , life satisfaction , and their interaction term show a main effect of nostalgia manipulation [ β = @card@ , t(263 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ ] on enjoyment of the day , and a main effect of life satisfaction [ β = @card@ , t(263 ) = @card@ , p < @card@ ] . further , a significant interaction between anticipatory nostalgia and life satisfaction be identify [ β = −0.44 , t(263 ) = −3.71 , p < @card@ ] . spotlight analysis be utilize to further investigate the moderate effect of life satisfaction ( Model 1 in SPSS with @card@ sample ; Hayes , @card@ ) . the model be significant , with a R2 = @card@ , p < @card@ . as expect , we find a significant interaction effect between anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation and early life satisfaction [ β = −0.44 , t(260 ) = −3.71 , p < @card@ ] on enjoyment of the day . for participant with a high life satisfaction ( at one standard deviation above the mean : life satisfaction = @card@ ) , anticipatory nostalgia lower their enjoyment , β = −0.42 , t(260 ) = −2.29 , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.78 , −0.06 ] , whereas the effect be reverse for those with a low life satisfaction ( at one standard deviation below the mean : life satisfaction = @card@ ) , β = @card@ , t(260 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ @card@ , @card@ ] ( Figure 4A ) . consistent with the finding from study 2 and 3 , when consumer be satisfy with their life , anticipatory nostalgia potentially increase anxiety and reduce enjoyment , but when consumer be not satisfy with their life , anticipatory nostalgia can decrease anxiety and increase enjoyment . ANOVA indicate a main effect of anticipatory nostalgia on perceive meaningfulness . in particular , at the end of the day , participant in the anticipatory-nostalgia group feel that they have a meaningful day to a great extent ( M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ) than do those in the control group [ M = @card@ , SD = @card@ ; F(1,263 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ ] . furthermore , consistent with the impact on enjoyment , anticipatory nostalgia do interact with life satisfaction to influence perceive meaningfulness , β = −0.35 , t(263 ) = −2.75 , p = @card@ . spotlight analysis be utilize to investigate further the moderate effect of life satisfaction ( Model 1 in SPSS with @card@ sample ; Hayes , @card@ ) . the model be significant , with a R2 = @card@ , p < @card@ . as expect , we find a significant interaction effect between the anticipatory-nostalgia manipulation and early life satisfaction , β = −0.35 , t(263 ) = −2.75 , p = @card@ , on meaningfulness of the day . for participant with a high life satisfaction ( at one standard deviation above the average life satisfaction : life satisfaction = @card@ ) , anticipatory nostalgia do not significantly influence their perceive meaningfulness of the day , β = −0.03 , t(260 ) = −0.16 , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ −0.41 , @card@ ] , whereas anticipatory nostalgia significantly improve the perceive meaningfulness of the day for those with a low life satisfaction ( life satisfaction = @card@ ) , β = @card@ , t(260 ) = @card@ , p = @card@ , @card@ % CI [ @card@ , @card@ ] ( Figure 4B ) . when consumer be not satisfy with their life , anticipatory nostalgia can increase the perceive meaning of their current experience . the result of study 4 support our hypothesis and extend our finding to life beyond the laboratory setting . anticipatory nostalgia help individual who be not fully satisfy with their life to find great enjoyment and meaning in their day . however , for those who be already highly satisfy with their life , anticipatory nostalgia reduce their enjoyment and do not enhance meaningfulness . the study report here make an important contribution to the recently conceived area of research on the construct of anticipatory nostalgia . prior study measure and explore anticipatory nostalgia as a dispositional trait . the present article examine anticipatory nostalgia as a transient state by introduce a state measure , identify a mechanism underlie the impact of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment , document the effect of contextual valence , and investigate its influence on enjoyment and meaningfulness in a real-life context . consistent with available research , the present finding support the usefulness of anticipatory nostalgia as a type of nostalgia , distinct from personal nostalgia . as in prior research with dispositional measure , the present research find a moderate correlation of state measure of anticipatory and personal nostalgia . overall , the present result add to existing evidence for the conclusion that anticipatory nostalgia be relate but not identical to personal nostalgia . prior research reveal that personal nostalgia predict a tendency toward happiness , whereas dispositional anticipatory nostalgia be associate with a generalize tendency toward sadness . similarly , study 2 of the present research find that the manipulation of state anticipatory nostalgia decrease enjoyment and positive affect . echo this , singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson sing about the threat of anticipatory nostalgia to a romantic relationship : “ this could be our last goodnight together . we may never pass this way again . just let me enjoy till it’s over or forever . please don’t tell me how the story end ” ( Kristofferson , @card@ ) . importantly , the present research advance the understanding of anticipatory nostalgia by identify anxiety as one mechanism underlie its impact . prior research provide evidence that anticipatory nostalgia reflect neither depression nor pessimism but a reluctance to let go of the present . paradoxically , the desire to hold on to the present might jeopardize full engagement with it . the present study suggest that anticipate future loss of the present raise anxiety and thereby decrease enjoyment and positive affect . on the other hand , study 3 reveal that when the present be challenging or unpleasant , anticipate change can reduce negative affect by create temporal distance from the problematic present . Study 4 extend the finding to a real-life application and conclude that anticipatory nostalgia raise anxiety and reduce enjoyment when people be highly satisfy with their life , but it decrease anxiety and increase enjoyment when people be not fully satisfy with their life . Construal theory suggest that temporal distance can effect a change in perspective and allow for reappraisal of the present . in a real-life setting , study 4 demonstrate that anticipatory nostalgia enhanced meaningfulness for people who be not fully satisfy with their life , i. e. , it perhaps encourage a great appreciation of the moment ( for what it be ) . the present finding provide insight into how to enhance experience in a variety of context , include marketing , education , and counseling . marketing strategy that employ method to trigger anticipatory nostalgia be most effective when they target challenging situation or connect message to present annoyance , inconvenience , or difficulty . marketer can tailor ad , especially on the Internet , to address target audience to arouse anticipatory nostalgia in those who will benefit most from such emotional engagement ( care for an ill relative , cope with the epidemic ) . similarly , school can enhance meaningfulness of their education for student by emphasize how they’ll miss it someday as well as explain its future usefulness . counselor can encourage positive reappraisal by engaging client in an analysis of present adverse circumstance from an imagine future perspective . future research be need to determine the circumstance under which anticipatory nostalgia can be constructive , or when it can be apply therapeutically to provide consolation by remind people that time be fleeting . the finding in study 4 of enhanced meaningfulness for people not fully satisfy with their life encourage future research into the possible therapeutic application of anticipatory nostalgia . Applied appropriately , perhaps anticipatory nostalgia can promote adaptive coping . the adoption of a future vantage point provide an opportunity for positive reappraisal of present adversity . Less clear be whether or how such mental distancing can enrich appreciation of the positive aspect of the present and increase attentiveness and engagement by remind people that the opportunity to enjoy the present will not last forever . the present study represent an important contribution to the advancement of research on anticipatory nostalgia . however , the absence of a manipulation check of the experience valence be a shortcoming in study 3 . although the same practice can be find in the existing literature ( Nicolao et al . , @card@ ) , we recommend that future research measure affect , both positive and negative , immediately after the experience recall task be complete as manipulation check ( Zhang et al . , @card@ ) . another limitation be the use of only @card@ participant in the factor analysis in the pilot test in study 1 . in future research , large sample size should be use to validate the measure . some question of interest not address by these study suggest opportunity for productive future effort . be people more likely to experience anticipatory nostalgia in positive or negative circumstance ? Could there be any individual difference lead consumer to respond differently to ad and text that invoke anticipatory nostalgia ? be people prone to anticipatory nostalgia more or less likely to experience the anxiety trigger by anticipatory nostalgia arise in the moment than be less prone individual ? be individual with a predisposition to anticipatory nostalgia more or less likely to employ it in unpleasant than in pleasant situation ? be the tendency to employ anticipatory nostalgia associate with age , other personality trait , or be it learn ? be there additional variable that moderate the influence of anticipatory nostalgia ? future research be need to determine whether construal level play a role in mediate the impact of anticipatory nostalgia on enjoyment , positive affect , or meaningfulness . by diminish involvement in the present , perhaps defensive distancing can threaten the quality of social interaction . it remain for future research to explore whether emotional distancing during unpleasant time ameliorate pain at the price of feel more alone or lonely . moreover , study be worth do to explore whether would there be any difference between the level of anticipatory nostalgia invoke by appeal of miss the present in near future ( e. g. , the next year ) vs. distant future ( e. g. , @card@ year later ) . by definition , anticipatory nostalgia be a form of nostalgia , so the finding of different effect of anticipatory nostalgia in positive and negative situation raise similar question about personal nostalgia . Can the benefit of nostalgia for the past also depend upon the context and intervene cognitive variable ? it also remain for future research to identify distinction between dispositional and transient state anticipatory nostalgia . further research be also need to distinguish anticipatory nostalgia from other loss relate concept , such as bereavement . by definition , anticipatory nostalgia would be expect to occur when change or loss be expect in the future . a person be not as likely to miss something they don’t expect to be different or lose someday . that say , not all item on the survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia ( Batcho and Shikh , @card@ ) be characterize by explicit negative tone . although item such as “ someone you love will leave someday ” do sample nostalgia for future loss , other item can be interpret in different way . for example , an item such as “ you’ll move to a new city , home or apartment ” can be optimistic and understand as promise good condition to come ( not unlikely for student look forward to move on from dormitory live to life after graduation ) . similarly , “ society will change ” can be interpret positively in term of scientific and social progress or future resolution of political or other division . while some change be accompany by sadness , much change ( especially in contemporary culture focus on scientific and technological progress ) , represent future improvement . nostalgia inherently engage positive and negative emotion , which be why question relate to when nostalgia be generally adaptive or maladaptive be of important theoretical and practical interest . unlike bereavement , anticipatory nostalgia be more likely to involve positive aspect of the future along with the sense of loss . for example , anticipatory nostalgia trigger by the realization that one’s child will not always remain young involve the possibility of many wonderful component of the future such as that child 1 day fall in love , get married , have child of their own . distinguish anticipatory nostalgia from anticipatory grief merit further research , give that the grief work perspective have dominate the bereavement literature ( Bonanno and Kaltman , @card@ ) . anticipatory grief be a term that describe a process in which an individual confront with impending loss initiate the grieve process in anticipation of that event . it be assume to be a positive adaptive response to expect loss . a recent study have suggest that anticipatory nostalgia may serve as a strategy to cope with loss ( Batcho , @card@ ) . future research conduct from the perspective of cope strategy be likely to be productive . together with the present finding , future research can enrich our understanding of the complex emotion of nostalgia and its implication for commercial application , psychological well-being , and quality of life . the dataset for study 4 be not publicly available because participant be not so instruct . the study involve human participant be review and approve by the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics College of Business Research Ethics Committee . the patients/participants provide their written informed consent to participate in this study .

Iron metabolism and lymphocyte characterisation during Covid-19 infection in ICU patient : an observational cohort study Covid-19 have be declare a pandemic by World Health Organization ( who ) on the 11th of March . the high contagiousness and the previously unknown clinical feature of this new viral infection put under pressure healthcare system and clinician worldwide . early report from the Chinese province of Hubei describe some predictive biomarkers for the clinical outcome of hospitalise patient , namely lymphopenia and the elevation of D-dimer , ferritin , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , troponin and myoglobin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) [ 1 , 2 ] . LDH be a marker of parenchymal lung damage , and troponin and myoglobin be marker of myocardial and muscular involvement , while the remain molecule belong to the group of positive acute-phase protein ( App ) . ferritin be a crucial component of iron metabolism , one of the most ancestral system of host protection from pathogen infection [ 3 ] . Iron be a micronutrient necessary for both energy production at a mitochondrial level and nucleic acid replication at cytoplasmic and nuclear level . for its scarcity in the human body and the fundamental process in which it be involve , pathogen ( bacterial , viral or fungal ) compete with the host for iron availability in order to guarantee their own replication . when innate immunity be activate and cytokine cascade start , IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate hepcidin expression in the liver , reduce iron bioavailability by decrease its gut absorption and hide it into ferritin , a shell-like molecule deposit in macrophage . these mechanism have be extensively review in the literature [ 4–8 ] . Lymphopenia and specific T cell lineage affection be characteristic feature of Covid-19 and have be correlate with poor prognosis [ 9–11 ] . in previous coronavirus outbreak , such as SARS , the peak of viral load occur 7 day after symptom development , follow by elevation in IL-6 and IL-8 , nadir lymphocyte count and successive pulmonary infiltrate . this description suggest that clinical symptom might be mediate by the immune system deregulation rather than direct viral damage [ @card@ ] . the distribution of different subtype of T cell in peripheral blood of symptomatic critical and non-critical Covid-19 patient have be describe [ 13–16 ] . with this observational study , we aim to provide a detailed description of iron metabolism and lymphocyte subpopulation in ICU Covid-19 population . it can lead to a good understanding of the underlie physiopathology of this unknown disease , foresee some possible alternative therapeutic target . this be a single-centre retrospective observational cohort study . the first COVID-19-positive patient in our ICU have be admit on the 5th of March @card@ . Data collection go from the 6th of March to the 6th of April @card@ , follow the local peak of epidemic . a protocol be establish to test predictive biomarkers . on the day of ICU admission and then twice-a-week ( on Monday and Thursday ) , every ICU patient be test for ferritin , serum iron , transferrin and transferrin saturation ( TfSat ) , soluble receptor of transferrin , CRP , D-dimer , LDH , troponin , lymphocyte count and characterisation of T cell ( CD3 , CD4 and CD8 ) , B cell and NK cell . then , datum be divide in the follow sub-categories : TI1-2 ( first dosage make on ICU admission ) , TI3-6 ( dosage between day 3 and 6 of ICU stay ) , TI @card@ and TI @card@ . we observe their trend during the first 2 week of ICU stay . due to laboratory restriction , just 9 patient be test for interleukin-6 ( IL6 ) only on the day of admission [ @card@ ] . every SARS-CoV-2-positive patient ( oropharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage sample , PCR test ) admit to our ICU be automatically enroll in the study . overall , @card@ patient enter in the final data analysis fulfill inclusion criterion . importantly , we count ICU length of stay ( los ) from the day of admission in the first ICU : this mean that dosage of patient transfer to our unit from other ICUs do not start from day 1 . Data collection be stop after day @card@ of ICU stay ; iron-related datum analysis be stop or not take into account for the final analysis if bacterial infection occur , since we consider it a known confound factor for inflammatory response ; patient be discharge from our analysis on the date of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) start ( 3 patient ) or death . all patient admit for strict clinical monitoring and discharge within @card@ h from ICU ; all admit patient who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 ; and no underage patient be include . overall , 6 patient be initially test but then exclude from the final analysis for the abovementioned criterion . the primary outcome be a descriptive analysis of iron metabolism value and lymphocyte count in ICU patient . then , as a secondary outcome , we try to correlate iron metabolism parameter and lymphocyte count with mortality or severity at the moment of ICU admission . severity at the moment of ICU admission be quantify with two parameter : mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio [ @card@ ] during the first @card@ h ( PFmed ) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [ @card@ ] ( PLR ) on the day of ICU admission ( datum report on Table 1 ) . Iron parameter be test with Cobas analyser system ( RocheⓇ ) , while lymphocyte subpopulation with the Navios ex flow cytometer ( Beckman CoultrerⓇ ) . the formula use to estimate TfSat ( TfSat = serum iron/(transferrin × @card@ ) × @card@ ) be not reliable for ferritin value above @card@ μg/L : in this case , those value be not include in final analysis . statistical analysis be perform use the software IBM SPSS @card@ . datum be report as mean with standard deviation ( std . Dev . ) , median with interquartile range ( IQR ) , number and percentage , depend on underlie distribution . Student’s t test , Mann–Whitney , Kruskal–Wallis , Spearman correlation and χ2 test be use for statistical analysis . table 1 summarise anthropometric feature and characteristic of our sample . the intubation rate be particularly elevate because in our hospital be present sub-intensive care unit and because ICU stay low than @card@ h ( only for strict monitoring purpose ) be an exclusion criterion . it be therefore likely the analysis account for a population of severely affect patient . CT scan pattern of low ( L ) or high ( H ) elastance refer to the phenotype propose by Gattinoni et al . [ @card@ ] . due to the exiguity of our sample and the different focus of our work , we intentionally do not test p value for the clinical feature report in Table 1 . a significant increase of TfSat level ( % ) occur between the first @card@ h of ICU stay and day 3 to 6 ( Mann–Whitney , p value = @card@ , Fig . 1 ) . no other significant trend and modification of iron parameter and lymphocyte subpopulation be find during ICU stay . lymphocyte and their subpopulation do not show significant trend of modification either . trend and modification of iron parameter be report in Fig . 1 , while trend and modification of lymphocyte count and lymphocytic subgroup be report in Fig . 2 . look to secondary outcome , neither iron parameter nor lymphocyte count correlate with mortality , PFmed or PLR . their value be report in Tables 2 , 3 and 4 . the already describe survival predictor in general hospital population ( LDH , troponin , CRP and D-dimer ) be not significantly associate with outcome , PLR or PFmed in our ICU population and do not show significant trend . datum be report in Table 5 . D-dimer show a non-significant tendency to increase after ICU admission ( Kruskal–Wallis , p value = @card@ , Fig . 3 ) . IL6 elevation be low than report by other study on critically ill Covid-19 patient [ @card@ ] . we find a debile correlation between IL6 level and lymphocyte count on the day of ICU admission ( 8 case , Spearman rho @card@ , p value = @card@ ) , but the analysis be limit by the low amount of case . Cytokines release hyper-expresses hepcidin , lead to ferroportin internalisation and reduce iron absorption and availability in body fluid [ @card@ , @card@ ] . serum iron and TfSat be know to decrease early after infection , inhibit iron availability to the pathogen , but then return to almost-normal value within 7–10 day [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the role of dysregulated iron response in Covid-19 have be recently review [ @card@ ] . serum iron do not show significant modification , but it follow the same trend of TfSat be part of the formula to calculate it . they both remain low than the normal reference value during the whole infection . it be difficult to hypothesise the reason of their trend without proper laboratory research : the dramatic low level at ICU admission might be expect , but the follow increase during an acute phase of inflammatory response seem counter-intuitive . the describe patient arrive in our ICU after a median of 7 to 9 day from symptom onset : the physiologic progressive restoration of normal TfSat after 1 week of infection and the dysregulated cytokine response might contribute to TfSat elevation . also , it have be describe that acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) cause reduce serum iron level [ @card@ ] : intubate Covid-19 patient suffer of this syndrome , while protective ventilation might theoretically restore normal iron level . ferritin be a very early and non-specific indicator of inflammation . it result to be the first severely elevated biomarker together with lymphopenia [ 1 ] : thus , its early dosage in at-home symptomatic patient might be extremely useful in individuating those who can benefit of early hospital admission . after its initial rise , ferritin can take longer than a month to normalise after an infection [ @card@ ] . thus , it remain elevate during ICU stay of Covid-19 patient . despite be apparently futile , its dosage constitute the key element to suspect secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( sHLH ) . sHLH be a frequently misdiagnose syndrome relate to viral infection and thus of primary importance in this Covid-19 pandemic . overall , despite unable of a more detailed description , we demonstrate how iron metabolism be derange in severe form of Covid-19 . lymphocyte be constantly reduce in ICU Covid-19 patient with respect to reference value . All the subset be also dramatically reduce , more than report by other recent publication refer to non-ICU population [ 9 , @card@ ] . we observe a conserve CD4/CD8 ratio . the nadir of lymphopenia be on day 2 of ICU stay ; a progressive tendency towards normalisation be more evident in patient experience positive outcome and ICU discharge . similar timing of lymphocyte modification be observe during severe acute respiratory disease ( SARS ) outbreak , despite with less dramatic reduction [ @card@ , @card@ ] . be refer to critically ill patient , this more severe reduction of all lymphocyte subgroup might be an indicator of severity . To date , no other publication be available about ICU population on lymphocyte subgroup . be such a specific subset of critically ill patient , many significant difference be not observable between survivor and non . these datum might be relevant to researcher for a good understanding of the altered immunologic response in severely affect patient and to ICU clinician . the study be affect by some limitation . the sanitary emergency and the previously unknown characteristic of this disease lead to many difficulty . during the initial phase , it have be difficult to create an effective protocol share between the operator and some datum have be miss . we have frequently act as a backup hospital to relieve other overload ICUs nearby : this mean that , for a part of the report case , the first few day of ICU stay occur in a different unit and the dosage of relevant marker be miss during that initial phase . be a monocentric study conceive during an emergency phase , the sample size be limit and can be increase : this lead to the impossibility to detect and describe some more subtle physiologic process . finally , slightly different therapeutic approach have be apply to patient follow ongoing finding and different complication ( ventilator-acquired pneumonia , pro-coagulative state , renal and hepatic insufficiency ) have affect patient ' evolution : it be not possible to quantify how these difference affect iron metabolism and lymphocyte count . we describe iron metabolism , lymphocyte subgroup count and other biomarkers in critically ill Covid-19 patient . this might be relevant for clinician deal with critical patient and provide further hint about the pathophysiology of this disease . Iron metabolism have be repeatedly propose as a potential therapeutic target during infection [ @card@ , @card@ ] . Pharmacologic advance have make available safe iron chelators [ @card@ ] . this testify the relevance of the topic investigate and how they might contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategy against Covid-19 .   MOOCs in Stem Education : teacher preparation and view advance in information and communication technology ( ICT ) have transform not only various field of knowledge ( from health to law ) but also how we perceive education . this change have lead to a revision of high education and promote the effort to integrate ICTs in high education ( Turan et al . @card@ ) . Recent development of ICT provide flexibility and facilitate access to information , lead to the emergence of online high education platform , one of which be massive open online course ( MOOCs ) . massive Open Online course be free and easily accessible course that allow thousand of people to receive education at the same time . MOOCs be inspire by the Connectivism and connective knowledge course develop by Downes and Siemens in @card@ ( Cormier and Siemens @card@ ) . massive Open Online course have attract widespread interest in the last decade , but they have be offer course and certificate on such websites as Coursera , edX , and Udemy since @card@ ( Baggaley @card@ ) . today , MOOCs be also use as a new version of e-learning in high education and professional development program ( Conole @card@ ; Laurillard @card@ ; Vivian et al . @card@ ; Wang et al . @card@ ) . massive Open Online course have be a point of controversy since they become part of high education and professional development program . for example , Martin ( @card@ ) and Miller ( @card@ ) argue that MOOCs be a disruptive innovation for high education , whereas Lederman ( @card@ ) state that they result in less learning than face-to-face education . besides , only about @card@ % of those who enroll in MOOCs complete the course , which be one of the major setback ( Bozna @card@ ; Castaño-Muñoz et al . @card@ ; Jordan @card@ ; Radoiu @card@ ) . another setback be the inadequate technological infrastructure of MOOCs ( Sukhbaatar et al . @card@ ) . however , MOOCs be become more and more popular and be increasingly use in high education because they be free of charge , have open resource , promote student–student interaction and contextual learning , and break the limit of time and space . massive Open Online course have two model ( Conole @card@ ; Daniel @card@ ) ; cMOOCs and xMOOCs . cMOOCs place heavy emphasis on knowledge production in network learn environment , while xMOOCs concentrate on repetition and presentation ( Conole @card@ ; Daniel @card@ ) . Coursera , edX , and Udemy be the most popular xMOOCs platform that offer course on different topic . xMOOCs be use in a wide range of area , especially computer engineering , philosophy , history , and nursing ( Bellack @card@ ; Sharma et al . @card@ ) . it have , however , not be long since MOOCs be integrate into professional development program for teacher ( Kellogg and Edelmann @card@ ; Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Laurillard @card@ ) . teacher can attend online course out of work whenever and wherever they want . therefore , MOOCs be use as an alternative to conventional teacher training program ( Koukis and Jimoyiannis @card@ ) . although MOOCs be gain popularity all over the world , their impact have be understudy ( Koukis and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Karlsson et al . @card@ ; Koukis and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Spradling et al . @card@ ) . besides , those study address such topic as code and the use of web-based tool in language teaching . however , few MOOCs concentrate on the field of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( Stem ) . the “ Stem @card@ ” by the American Institutes for Research ( @card@ ) state that MOOCs can be use for Stem education . Subbian ( @card@ ) also argue that MOOCs can be use to facilitate interdisciplinary education by teach Stem field . stem education be an interdisciplinary approach to learning that integrate the four discipline of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics and have long be use in numerous country ( the USA , the UK , Canada , etc. ) ( Sahin @card@ ) . those country apply Stem education to achieve economic and technological advance , to establish a link between school and industry , and to increase science and mathematics literacy ( Türk et al . @card@ ) . moreover , Stem education help student develop the creativity , problem-solve , and critical think skill require by the 21st-century business world . therefore , country integrate Stem education into formal and informal education . teacher play an essential role in this process ( Yıldırım 2020a ) , but only those who have a good grasp of Stem education can integrate it into formal and informal education ( Yıldırım and Şahin-Topalcengiz @card@ ) . although Stem education be new to Turkey , many teacher be interested in learn it , increase the demand for related course . however , there be few people in Turkey with a Ph. D. in Stem education , and only a certain number of people be allow to enroll in Stem course , result in unmet demand ( Colakoglu and Gokben @card@ ) . moreover , Stem course be too expensive and too short for teacher . Research show that a teacher ideally need @card@ h of training to achieve professional development ( Johnson and Fargo @card@ ; Supovitz and Turner @card@ ) . moreover , teacher be unable to attend long-term course in Stem education because they take place during the semester , point to the need for free and open online Stem course offer by expert . teacher should be provide with free-of-charge and always-accessible online Stem education course offer by expert . not all teacher can have training in Stem education , due to different work condition and socioeconomic status . however , they all can access online Stem course and attend them whenever and wherever they want . massive Open Online Courses can , therefore , be use for online Stem education . teacher can also take them to improve themselves during the Covid-19 pandemic that have take hold of the whole world . To that end , an 80-h free training on Stem education be design for participant in line with the Stem Teacher Institutes model ( Yıldırım 2020b ) . the training be base on xMOOCs , allow attendee to receive direct information about Stem field . this study be important because it be the first to offer long and free xMOOC training on Stem field to teacher in Turkey . moreover , teacher be expect to acquire professional knowledge and develop professional skill and attitude in Stem education . we , therefore , believe that this study will pave the way for further research on this topic . in this context , this study aim to determine how teacher perceive MOOCs for Stem education . the main research question be , “ What be teacher ' view of MOOCs for Stem education ? ” To this end , the study seek answer to the follow subquestions : How do teacher define MOOCs ? why do teacher use MOOCs ? What do teacher think be the benefit of MOOCs ? What effect do teacher think MOOCs have on professional competence ? in what way do teacher think they can use MOOCs in their class ? What problem do teacher face during MOOCs ? phenomenology , which be a qualitative research method , be use to determine the effect of MOOCs in Stem education . phenomenology be use to determine how people experience and make sense of a phenomenon or an event ( Yıldırım and Şimşek @card@ ) . this be a phenomenological study because it aim to determine how participant perceive MOOCs and what meaning they attribute to them . participant be recruit use criterion sampling , which involve the selection of a sample that meet a predetermine set of criterion ( Yıldırım and Şimşek @card@ ) . criterion sampling be a time- and cost-efficient method by which researcher select participant most suit to the research purpose ( Patton @card@ ) . Three hundred and ninety-five teacher be enroll in MOOCs ( STEM-PDT-MOOCS ) design for the professional development program for teacher ( PDT ) in Stem education . those who meet the specified criterion be include in the sample . table 1 table 2 show the sampling procedure . among @card@ participant , @card@ watch all the course video and course introduction video . of the @card@ participant , @card@ complete all assignment . of the @card@ participant , @card@ both participate in the discussion form and complete the training successfully . of the @card@ participant , only @card@ express their view of the process . the sample consist of @card@ teacher from different city of Turkey who meet the inclusion criterion . participant be assign pseudonym ( Ali , Ayşe , Mehmet , etc. ) in order to assure anonymity . table 2 show the participant ' demographic characteristic . semi-structured interview be conduct to determine participant ' view . a form for massive Open Online Courses in Stem Education ( FSEMOOCs ) be develop for interview . the purpose of the semi-structured interview form be to help the researcher to control the course of the interview ( Merriam @card@ ) . it be make sure that the FSEMOOCs item be easy to understand , open-ended , and allow for follow-up question . the FSEMOOCS consist of six item . it be send to two expert ( one in Stem education , and the other in information technology ) . the FSEMOOCS be revise base on their feedback . a pilot study be conduct with two teacher to determine the intelligibility of the FSEMOOCs , which be then finalize base on the result . Table1 show two of the FSEMOOCs item . “ Appendix \" show all FSEMOOCS item . table 3 qualitative datum be collect through face-to-face interview . each interview last 10–30 min and be record . the interview be transcribe and then analyze use content analysis . first , code be develop from the transcript by the researcher and an expert . content analysis be perform by two people to ensure validity and reliability . the part on which the researcher and the expert agree and disagree during code be identify . they discuss the code on which they disagree and reach a consensus . second , a literature review be conduct to develop category and theme and to assign the code to them . table 4 show the theme and some of the code . table 4 present explanation for the theme and some code to allow reader to understand them good . STEM-PDT-MOOCs consist of two stage . in the first stage , STEM-PDT-MOOCs be design . in the second stage , teacher be train . the following be detailed information on the design process of STEM-PDT-MOOCs . determine the objective : objective of STEM-PDT-MOOCs be determine , which be raise teacher ' awareness of MOOCs and ensure that they learn the program content and pedagogy appropriate for Stem education . choose a platform for training : the distance education system of the university be use for STEM-PDT-MOOCs . determine the duration of STEM-PDT-MOOCs : a teacher need at least @card@ h of training to achieve professional development ( Johnson and Fargo @card@ ; Supovitz and Turner @card@ ) . Hodges et al . ( @card@ ) argue that MOOCs should be long-term so that they can provide teacher with a sustainable learning opportunity . Polly and Hannafin ( @card@ ) also state that long-term training promote teacher ' professional development . therefore , an 80-h training be design . determine the format of MOOCs for STEM-PDT-MOOCs : the format be base on xMOOCSs , which , unlike conventional online learning , allow teacher to learn directly . create STEM-PDT-MOOCs content : it be make sure that MOOCs address different component , such as course introduction and course registration video , live class , discussion forum , assignment , and assessment activity ( Agarwal @card@ ; Chamberlin and Parish @card@ ; Evans @card@ ) . afterward , Stem education content be determine because it be state that education content for teacher should focus on a field and offer pedagogy specific to it ( Polly et al . @card@ ) . therefore , specific content be develop . table 5 provide information on STEM-PDT-MOOCs component and content . registration : participant who apply for STEM-PDT-MOOCs be enroll . course attendance system : it include course attendance during STEM-PDT-MOOCs . the system send reminder to those who do not attend class . course completion and evaluation : MOOCs be evaluate , and course be complete . the result be present as theme , code , and quotation to allow reader to analyze and interpret them easily . the first subquestion focus on participant ' definition of MOOCs . table 6 show the result . participant ' definition of MOOCs be group under six code . they mostly define them as either online course with different component or as an online version of undergraduate education . the second subquestion address why participant use MOOCs for Stem education . table 7 show the result . the third subquestion address participant ' view of the benefit of MOOCs for Stem education . table 8 show the result . participant who find MOOCs useful in Stem education be ask what kind of benefit they think MOOCs have . table 9 show the result . the fourth subquestion address participant ' view on the effect of MOOCs on professional competence . table @card@ show the result . most participant state that MOOCs help them develop professional competence , while only two state that MOOCs do not affect it . participant who find MOOCs useful be ask in what way MOOCs help them develop professional competence . table @card@ show the result . participant state that MOOCs help them develop general competence in many respect . their view be group under three subcategory ; “ professional knowledge , ” “ professional skill , ” and “ attitude and value . ” they note that MOOCs teach them about Stem field , pedagogy , and course planning , and encourage them to inquire . the fifth subquestion address participant ' view of integrate MOOCs into their class . table @card@ show the result . participant who be interested in use MOOCs in their class be ask why they be so . table @card@ show the result . participant who be not interested in use MOOCs in their class be ask why that be the case . table @card@ show the result . the sixth subquestion address the problem participant face during MOOCs . table @card@ show the result . this study investigate teacher ' view of MOOCs for Stem education and reach the follow result : the first subquestion address participant ' definition of MOOCs . they define MOOCs as free-access online educational platform consist of video and forum . this result show that they understand what a MOOC be because their definition of MOOCs be similar to those in the literature . for example , Misra ( @card@ ) define MOOCs as an open educational program . Nortvig and Christiansen ( @card@ ) define them as an online and free educational platform that be available for anyone to enroll . Margaryan et al . ( @card@ ) define them as a new version of online learning . the second subquestion address why participant use MOOCs for Stem education . they use MOOCs because they be flexible , certified , and free of charge course with STEM-related content teach by qualified instructor . Kirschner ( @card@ ) and Martin ( @card@ ) also report that attendee use MOOCs because they would like to learn about a specific field and receive a certificate at the end of training for free . Young ( @card@ ) emphasize that one of the main reason why learner use MOOCs be because they receive a certificate at the end of the training . accord to Bali ( @card@ ) , teacher use MOOCs because they have the opportunity to observe online learn environment , participate in discussion , experience student specialization , and have access to free resource of high quality . Brooks and Gibson ( @card@ ) also report that teacher use MOOCs because those course be flexible , facilitate teacher–teacher communication , and can be attend anywhere , anytime . these result show that teacher use online education service when they be provide with appropriate learning platform . the fact that our participant highlight the content of MOOCs and the qualification of instructor show that they want to get the right information . the third subquestion address participant ' view of the benefit of MOOCs in Stem education . most participant find MOOCs useful in Stem education , which be consistent with the literature . Subbian ( @card@ ) state that MOOCs can be use to facilitate interdisciplinary education , to achieve learn in Stem field , and to teach the pedagogy of Stem education . both our result and those of other show that MOOCs can be use in Stem education . some study suggest that MOOCs can also be use to teach topic relate to specific field . for example , Parson et al . ( @card@ ) report that most teacher find MOOCs useful for professional development , which be in line with our result . however , some study argue that MOOCs be not useful ( Martin @card@ ; Miller @card@ ; Sukhbaatar et al . @card@ ) , which be in contrast to our result . these result show that MOOCs be a new online educational platform that warrant further research . the COVID-19\n",
            "pandemic have also show how crucial online education be . MOOCs play a vital role in sustain education during outbreak and other extraordinary circumstance . in other word , they be a useful source of training and education for both educator and learner . moreover , they be convenient because they be easily accessible to anyone interested in deepen their knowledge whenever and wherever they want . therefore , they allow people to access education @card@ and support lifelong learning . the result show that they can be use to continue education in both ordinary and extraordinary situation , like the COVID-19 pandemic . participant think that MOOCs provide information on pedagogy , technology , and engineering . Donitsa-Schmidt and Beverley Topaz ( @card@ ) also state that MOOCs provide field knowledge , pedagogical knowledge , and pedagogical field knowledge . our participant believe that MOOCs also improve communication and collaboration , which be consistent with the literature ( Al-Rahmi et al . @card@ ; Sharov et al . @card@ ; Skiba @card@ ; Yuan and Powell @card@ ) . this be a significant result because the exchange of idea and collaboration be essential for the professional development of teacher ( Jho et al . @card@ ; Jones and Carter @card@ ) . the fourth subquestion address the effect of MOOCs on professional competence . the result show that MOOCs help teacher develop professional competence . Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis ( @card@ ) and Misra ( @card@ ) also argue that MOOCs can be use as an alternative for the professional development of teacher because they help teacher develop Web @card@ knowledge and professional skill . overall , MOOCs can also be an alternative to in-service training . another result of the fourth subquestion be that participant think that MOOCs improve professional knowledge , professional skill , and attitude and value ​​in various way . they believe that MOOCs teach them about Stem field , pedagogy , course planning , and communication , and collaboration . Donitsa-Schmidt and Beverley Topaz ( @card@ ) and Urrutia et al . ( @card@ ) also note that MOOCs help teacher develop professional , technological , and academic skill . MOOCs be useful in teach subject-specific topic as well ( Karlsson et al . @card@ ; Koukis and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis @card@ ; Spradling et al . @card@ ) . our result be consistent with the literature , indicate that well-plan MOOCs can help teacher develop professional competence . the fifth subquestion address participant ' view of use MOOCs in lecture . most participant be interested in use MOOCs in their class to revise difficult topic , to keep track of student and their assignment , and to create a safe environment for discussion . this result have be report by Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis ( @card@ ) and Bruff et al . ( @card@ ) as well . this result indicate that teacher be open to improve themselves and learn about new approach . however , some participant be not interested in use MOOCs in their class because they think that MOOCs reduce the quality of education and increase the workload and also because not every student have the technological infrastructure in their home . this result have be report by some study as well ( Lederman @card@ ; Sukhbaatar et al . @card@ ) . this result indicate that those participant be not interested in improve themselves and learn about new approach . the sixth subquestion address the problem that participant face during MOOCs . participant have to deal with Internet connection issue , communication problem , problem with the discussion form , weak student–teacher interaction , poor video quality , inadequate measurement and evaluation , and lack of practice . moreover , one of the most critical problem of MOOCs be the lack of feedback , accord to most participant . however , it be impossible to give feedback to everyone on time due to the nature of MOOCs ( Hodges et al . @card@ ; Roth @card@ ) , which be why student–student interaction be so crucial in MOOCs . these result be similar to ours , suggest that give instant feedback to attendee during MOOCs ensure success . our participant also state that the lack of feedback during MOOCs reduce their motivation . participant lose motivation during MOOCs , make it all the more difficult for them to concentrate on class . Research also show that motivation play a key role in complete MOOCs ( Alraimi et al . @card@ ; Barba et al . @card@ ) . learner face some other problem during MOOCs , such as low teacher-student interaction , a lack of an open environment for discussion , and insufficient infrastructure ( Ji and Cao @card@ ; Karlsson et al . @card@ ; King et al . @card@ ; Rice @card@ ; Christensen and Alcorn @card@ ) . insufficient infrastructure , reduce motivation , and the lack of feedback be the major obstacle to MOOCs because the completion rate for the most MOOCs be moderate . MOOCs help teacher develop professional competence . in case of an excessive number of teacher and inadequate in-service training , MOOCs can be use as an alternative to professional development program and in-service training . online learning have become necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic because school closure worldwide have leave million of student out of school . MOOCs ensure that education continue regardless of the circumstance . therefore , teacher can use them both to receive Stem education and to improve themselves in other field . for example , Coursera offer online course for anyone interested in engineering . in this context , MOOCs provide teacher with the opportunity to improve professional competence and ensure lifelong learning . our result show that there should also be MOOCs design for teacher who be interested in improve themselves but want to do it where they be . such MOOCs can meet teacher ' learn need and promote personal development . the problem that teacher face should be take into account when design MOOCs . for example , the completion rate for MOOCs be moderate due to the loss of motivation and the lack of feedback . therefore , MOOCs should be design in such a way that they can increase participant ' motivation and allow for feedback . some participant be interested in use MOOCs in their class while some other be not . teacher ' view should be take into consideration , and class should integrate MOOCs with face-to-face learning . we believe that this type of teaching can improve the quality of education and encourage learner to engage more in learn . further research should address the effect of MOOCs combine with face-to-face learning . this study show that MOOCs should be use in Stem education . further research should be conduct to well understand the effect of MOOCs on teacher training and to identify its challenge in order to design the good learning experience . the study have three limitation . first , the sample consist only of Turkish teacher who be interested in Stem education , and therefore , the result can be generalize . second , the sample size be too small to understand the advantage and disadvantage of MOOCs for teacher training well . third , phenomenology be the method of choice for capture teacher ' experience with MOOCs . however , phenomenology may fall short of obtain in-depth and detailed information on the phenomenon in question .   COVID-19 Vaccination for Persons with Parkinson’s Disease : light at the end of the Tunnel ? the risk of become infected with the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , which lead to the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) , be a serious concern for person with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) worldwide . report indicate that the likelihood of become infected be not high for those living with PD , but the risk of experience the serious respiratory disease and sequela of COVID-19 do appear to be elevate , at least in late stage of PD [ 1 ] . furthermore , both motor and non-motor symptom of PD can worsen considerably as a result of COVID-19 [ 2 ] . finally , the risk of die in conjunction with SARS-CoV-2 infection also appear to be high for person with PD compare to the general population [ 3 , 4 ] . until recently , physical distancing , face mask and eye protection be the only strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [ 5 ] . thus , recommendation from public health agency have be to stay at home and limit direct contact with other to mitigate the risk of become infected . this social isolation and the justifiable fear of infection can be associate with stress , anxiety and depression [ 6 , 7 ] . the risk for mental health challenge seem extra high for people live with PD who be particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effect of stress and the inability to exercise adequately [ 8 , 9 ] . fortunately , there may now be light at the end of the tunnel , thank to several COVID-19 vaccine that have be approve in multiple country for emergency use accord to governmental immunization program . in many country , these program start with the inoculation of high-risk people–health care provider , senior , and people with co-morbidities , so the initial vaccination wave will likely also include people with PD . the rapid development and approval of COVID-19 vaccine have create some concern in the scientific and medical community , as well as among the general public , in regard to the benefit and risk of these new vaccine . many physician have already receive phone call from worried person with PD or their family , ask about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in the specific context of PD and the dopaminergic medication . we be in a unique situation where concerted global effort be be make to rapidly combat a catastrophic pandemic , at an unprecedented pace . we fully understand that this speed of development may give rise to concern about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety , both among person with PD and among physician look after these individual . To address critical question about these vaccine , some of them base on new technology ( e. g. , mRNA-based and viral vector vaccine ) , it be important to first discuss the path lead to vaccine approval for emergency or limited-term use by the regulatory agency . we will then discuss the present perspective of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society , who have ask its Scientific Issues Committee ( IPMDS-SIC ) to provide information regard the COVID-19 vaccination , which be paramount to the protection of our community of patient , physician and associate health provider in the current critical situation of the global pandemic . Two COVID-19 vaccines—BNT162b2 ( Pfizer/BioNTech ) and mRNA-1273 ( Moderna)—were recently approve via emergency use authorization by several international entity ( U. S. Food & Drug Administration [ FDA ] ; and current regular but restricted authorization of the European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] , among other agency ) . this process include thorough analysis of complete Phase III datum provide by vaccine developer in a transparent process with peer-reviewed publication of full datum set [ 10–15 ] . the recent FDA and EMA approval of these vaccine meet the high standard require for use authorization after complete datum scrutiny and validation , as require in the normal process of a vaccine approval . the process ensure that the efficacy and safety requirement have be meet and people can be inoculate because the vaccine benefit outweigh its risk . additional COVID-19 vaccine that be still in clinical development Phases II and III will eventually undergo the same scrutiny before emergency use authorization . transparency about the development and approval process be very important . the efficacy and safety of the approve vaccine be fully disclose in the published paper [ 10–15 ] . we should note that , in addition to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine , different vaccine be currently also be use in various country . this include the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine ( AZD1222 , Oxford-AstraZeneca ) , a chimpanzee adenovirus-vector vaccine , which have be approve for temporary supply in the United Kingdom , and recently also for wide use in the European union by the EMA , base on a Phase I/II , single-blind , randomize controlled trial [ @card@ ] and a single-blind , randomise , control , Phase II/III trial [ @card@ ] . this vaccine appear to have an acceptable safety profile , but it be uncertain how effective this vaccine be for those over @card@ year of age because this age group be unrepresented in the study . we must await publication of the Phase III trial result . still other vaccine be be use in country such as China and Russia , but we can make any statement about their efficacy or safety as we do not have access to publish datum . To date , the approve COVID-19 vaccine have prove to be highly effective in prevent the severe and even the mild form of the disease . high efficacy ( >90 % ) have be demonstrate regardless of race , gender , age , and medical condition . by comparison , datum obtain during the @card@ influenza season indicate that the overall effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for prevent influenza virus infection in child and adult be estimate at only @card@ % [ @card@ ] . similar to other vaccine , there be some side effect with the recently approve COVID-19 vaccine . for the most part , side effect have be mild ( pain and irritation at the injection site , fatigue , muscle pain , headache , low fever/chills ) [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in addition , reactogenicity ( allergic reaction to vaccine ) be observe only occasionally , as be typically see with other vaccine . a finding with possible importance for the elderly PD population be the notion that young adult ( @card@ year ) tend to have more severe reaction than old adult ( 65–85 year ) , at least within the framework of the publish clinical trial . however , a word of caution be in place here , because the experience with adverse event will grow as an increase number of person will be vaccinate . To illustrate this , recent observation in Norway have reveal that follow vaccination of around @card@ person , a total of @card@ death have occur that be consider possibly related to vaccination , as these person be treat within six day prior to death [ @card@ , @card@ ] . it be uncertain whether a truly causal relationship exist between these death and the preceding vaccination . it be important to note that these death all occur in severely frail and elderly ( over @card@ year of age ) person live in long-term care facility , and many of them have serious underlie medical condition or terminal illness [ @card@ ] . all symptom and adverse event post-vaccination be be report and datum thoroughly collect to determine the actual relation to the vaccine . at this point and until detail of the report death be analyze , no conclusion can be draw about causality . vaccine with proven efficacy and what appear to be a satisfactory safety profile be now hopefully go to significantly contribute to end the COVID-19 pandemic that have already take many life . the question remain as to what the impact of COVID-19 vaccination be for the worldwide population of people live with PD . in this regard , it be important to emphasize that as of today , there be currently no scientific datum that have specifically look at the efficacy and safety of COVID @card@ vaccination for person with PD . any specific claim about the efficacy and safety for this specific population therefore have to be make cautiously , and be merely base upon extrapolate the evidence from general elderly population , and the experience as progressively more people with PD be be vaccinate worldwide . bear these caveat in mind , and base on our interpretation of the literature plus the unfold experience with widespread vaccination in the population at large , the IPMDS-SIC have the follow consideration in relation to PD . ( 1 ) the approve mRNA-based vaccine and the viral vector vaccine under development induce immunization through mechanism that be not know to interact with the neurodegenerative process in PD . with respect to the inflammation that be associate with the pathogenesis of PD , there be no evidence of a direct interaction with the immune response to these vaccine . ( 2 ) the report Phase III datum of the approve vaccine show that the type or incidence of side effect in person with PD have not be different than in the general population . the vaccine appear to be safe for old adult , with less side effect than in young adult . the Norwegian experience with very frail elderly person live in long-term care facility suggest that extra caution be need for this specific subgroup of the frail elderly with several clinically relevant comorbidities [ @card@ ] . it therefore seem prudent to remain careful with administer the vaccine to very frail and terminally ill elderly person with PD , and to openly discuss the risk with patient and family prior to vaccination , set against an already limited life expectancy . ( 3 ) similar to reaction to other immunization , COVID-19 vaccination be not know to interfere with the current therapy of PD . ( 4 ) as some person with PD may be part of the first group in the current vaccination program because of their age , residency in long-term care facility , or other reason relate to PD disability , more datum will become available in the near future for further analysis of the impact of these vaccine on PD . a cautious approach remain necessary , as we have see historical example in our field where drug such as tolcapone initially appear to be safe within the setting of a clinical trial ( albeit in only several hundred of patient ) , but where very serious hepatotoxicity emerge in a few individual only after more widespread introduction into daily clinical practice [ @card@ ] . study of vaccine , include those of the COVID-19 vaccine , typically include much large study population ( ten of thousand of participant ) , but this do not preclude detection of possible adverse effect after the introduction of widespread vaccination campaign [ @card@ ] . we therefore strongly encourage reader to periodically refer to the website of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society , where the recommendation will be update in a live document , as new datum be publish and as we gain more experience from both further trial and real-life clinical practice ( https : //www . movementdisorders . org/MDS-Files1/COVID-19vaccination01042021 . pdf for medical professional , https : //www . movementdisorders . org/COVID-19-Pandemic-MDS/MDS-COVID-19-Vaccine-Statement-for-Patients . htm for person with PD ) . take together , we encourage our community of movement disorder specialist to recommend COVID-19 vaccination with approve vaccine to their patient with PD ( or their responsible caregiver ) , unless there be a specific contraindication . some caution seem warrant in very frail person with PD living in long-term care facility . we also recommend that person with PD come forward themselves to discuss the vaccine with their physician . this recommendation to both physician and patient be give because the benefit and risk do not appear to be different than in the general ( age-matched ) population , while the risk of develop the serious , life-threatening complication of a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection do appear to be high for person live with PD , at least among those with more advanced disease . finally , even after vaccination , it be important that person with PD continue comply with the public health guideline to reduce exposure and transmission of COVID-19 as recommend by who and CDC . the author have no conflict of interest to report .   clinical predictor of SARS-CoV-2 Testing pressure on Clinical Laboratories : a Multinational Study Analyzing Google Trends and over @card@ Million Diagnostic Tests the weekly number of SARS-CoV-2 test perform in Italy and the United States ( USA ) be retrieve by search the official website of the Italian National Institute of Health ( IstituSuperiore di Sanità ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . datum be retrieve from both websites for a period between March 1 ( Ie , the beginning of the outbreak in the 2 country ) and December @card@ , @card@ . a concomitant electronic search be carry out in Google Trends ( Google Inc. , Mountain View , Ca ) , use the Italian and English term for the most common symptom describe by COVID-19 patient : febbre ( fever ) , tosse ( cough ) , dispnea ( dyspnea ) , perdita olfatto ( olfactory loss ) , perdita gusto ( taste loss ) , and Mal di testa ( headache ) . a weekly Google Trends score be obtain for each keyword , reflect the cumulative number of Google search during the previous 7 days. Data from Google Trends be retrieve for each country and keyword independently . cross-correlation analysis be conduct to identify time lag that provide the high possible correlation between the Google Trends search and SARS-CoV-2 testing ( Ie , the amount of time between when a search be conduct and when a test be administer ) . Time-series linear regression be perform for each search term to evaluate its predictive value in estimate the weekly number of SARS-CoV-2 test . To adjust for the vary accessibility and number of available diagnostic test over the course of local outbreak , a numeric variable represent the epidemiologic month be include in each model . further variable selection be base on the previous cross-correlation analysis . model performance be assess use adjusted R2 and graphical analysis . all statistical analysis be perform use R software ( the R Project for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . the study be conduct in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki , under the term of relevant local legislation . this analysis be base on electronic search in unrestricted , publicly available repository , so that no informed consent or ethical committee approval be need . a total of @card@ SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test , @card@ test from Italy and @card@ from the USA , be analyze over the study period . the result of the cross-correlation analysis be present in Table 1 . in the datum from Italy , fever , cough , and dyspnea provide the high correlation with no time lag , headache and smell loss hit their peak cross-correlation coefficient when there be a time lag of 2 week , and taste loss have its high correlation when there be a time lag of 3 week . in the USA , fever , cough , taste loss , and dyspnea provide the high correlation with the number of SARS-CoV-2 test when the Google Trends search have a time lag of 1 week . the term headache reach its peak correlation when there be a 4-week time lag , and smell loss have its high correlation when there be no time lag . Time-series linear regression analysis ( Table 2 ) show that the effect of the Google Trends search series for fever ( a lag of 2 week ) , headache ( a lag of 3 week ) , cough ( a lag of 2 week ) , and dyspnea ( lag of both 1 and 2 week ) be each significant when adjust for the monthly trend of an increase in test in the USA , and all provide adjusted R2 value of >77 % . neither smell nor taste loss show significant effect in the number of weekly test . the model that provide the high coefficient of determination for this datum , R2 = @card@ % , include a combination of cough ( a lag of 2 week ) , fever ( a lag of 2 week ) , and headache ( a lag of 3 week ) in addition to the monthly trend . similar result be find use the Italian datum : both fever and cough , when there be a 2-week time lag , have significant effect on the number of weekly SARS-CoV-2 test and provide adjusted R2 value of @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively , when adjust for the monthly trend . the same be observe for smell loss , when there be a 2-week time lag , produce an adjusted R2 of @card@ % . taste loss also have significant effect on the number of weekly test , at both @card@ and 3-week time lag , with an adjusted R2 of @card@ % . the term headache provide the model with the high adjusted R2 ( @card@ % ) , when there be a time lag of both 1 and 2 week . the Google Trends search series for the term dyspnea have no significant effect on the weekly test number . the 2 model with the high adjusted R2 for each country be represent in Figure 1 . the result of our analysis show that Google Trends datum can anticipate the demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test . overall , the result be relatively consistent between both country . interestingly , we observe that nonspecific symptom ( fever , headache , and cough ) be the good predictor for the number of weekly diagnostic test 2 to 3 week after the search be conduct . this result contrast with datum previously observe for predict the number of patient diagnose weekly with COVID-19 use the same symptom keywords , in which specific symptom , Ie , taste loss and smell loss , be the good predictors.5 we suspect that this contrast be because nonspecific COVID-19 symptom can result from numerous other condition , which may also have seasonal variability , such as the common cold or allergy , all of which be likely to lead individual to seek SARS-CoV-2 testing . our study be limit by its retrospective design and the fact that access to COVID-19 testing , availability of test kit , number of test perform , and public health testing program may have all change over the course of the pandemic . we control for this by use the month as a variable in the linear regression . base on the result of our analysis , we recommend that clinical laboratory and public health official monitor weekly Google Trends score for nonspecific symptom search , which can obtain freely and easily in second and on a more localized , regional level . a @card@ to 3-week lag for the keywords fever , headache , and cough to anticipate testing demand would enable clinical laboratory to stock up on reagent and plan staffing accordingly and to inform public health official to set up pop-up testing site and allocate additional resource to upcoming hot spot , as appropriate .   SARS-COV-2 antibody dynamics and B-cell memory response over-time in COVID-19 convalescent subject Coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) be a devastating severe disease responsible for over @card@ million infection since its emergence in December @card@ , lead to high rate of morbidity and mortality [ 1 ] . the basis of protective immunity after infection include the production of antigen specific antibody response , and the generation of memory adaptive immune response mediate by B and T-cell [ @card@ ] . little be know about the development of long-term humoral immunity and the generation of memory B cell follow COVID-19 infection , or the ease to activate humoral immune response during recurrent infection . factor that determine the fate of activate B cell after primary antigen encounter need to be investigate to shed light on the following : ( 1 ) whether COVID-19 infection can lead to sustained antibody protection and whether the absence of specific S1 spike antibody necessarily mean absence of immune response ; ( 2 ) what be the longevity of this humoral response ; and ( 3 ) what be the magnitude of immune protection for individual in whom the early post-infection humoral immunity decay over-time . well understand the humoral response and test the behavior of memory B cell follow COVID-19 infection be crucial for plan future trajectory and will likely enhance our ability to overpower the disease . in the current study , we longitudinally portray SARS-COV-2 antibody response in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 convalescent subject and assess memory B cell response in relation to time post infection . blood sample be collect from a cohort of subject recover from COVID-19 disease and from healthy subject that donate blood . convalescent subject be recruit through local networking and local medium , and all have a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 disease by positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab . antibody response be measure at multiple time point define as month after positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab , as follow : @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ month . in a sub-cohort the same subject be follow over time and sample be collect respectively . this study be approve by Sheba Institutional Review Board SMC-750320 ) and informed consent be obtain from all enroll participant . each patient record be code for anonymity to ensure confidentiality during statistical analysis . immunoassay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in blood sample be perform use Euroimmun ( EI , Lubeck , Germany ) anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantitative Elisa kit base on a recombinant S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein . the test have a sensitivity of @card@ % and specificity of @card@ % . test be perform in accordance with manufacturer instruction , use AGILITY® automated Elisa analyzer ( DYNEX Technologies Inc. , Chantilly , VA ) , and optical density be measure at @card@ nm . result be present at a grange from 0 to @card@ , and a value high than @card@ be considered positive [ 4 ] . analysis be perform at various time period follow positive RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab . cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B-cells be perform in a randomly select group of COVID-19 recover subject . we use reversed antigen human IgG SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) ELISpotPLUS ( Alp kit , Mabtech , Sweden ) accord to manufacturer instruction . briefly , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) be incubate ( @card@ cells/well ) on an anti-IgG FluoroSpot plate after stimulation with a mixture of Toll-like receptor agonist R848 ( Resiquimod , 1mkg/ml ) and IL2 ( 10ng/ml ) ( B-cell stimpack , Mabtech , Sweden ) . the number of SARS-COV-2 specific IgG secrete B-cells be measure as spot form unit ( SFU ) use Mabtech IRISTM reader . the result be express as the number SFU per @card@ seed cell after subtract the background of unstimulated cell . the positive cut-off value be determine as high than @card@ SFU ( high number of SFU in COVID-19 uninfected healthy subject , N=5 ) . continuous variable be evaluate for a normal distribution and describe as median and interquartile range ( IQRs ) . categorical variable be describe as number and percentage . To compare the relative change in SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurement between various time point the two-tailed , non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test be use . the rate of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody decline be calculate as the change in SARS-CoV-2 IgG level divide by the time difference between the repeated test . Pearson correlation be apply for assess the time from positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal with antibody level . the pair T-test be apply ( pair observation ) to evaluate the statistical significance of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurement in the same subject in different time point . a one-way ANCOVA be conduct to compare between group whilst adjust for time follow positive RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab . multivariate linear regression model use the enter approach be apply for simultaneously assess the effect of independent variable on a quantitative dependent variable . P value less than @card@ be consider statistically significant . statistical analysis be perform use Python , IBM SPSS and R software ( version @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ , respectively ) . we screen @card@ COVID-19 convalescent subject , @card@ male ( @card@ % ) , @card@ female ( @card@ % ) , median , ( @card@ – @card@ % IQR ) age @card@ ( @card@ – @card@ ) year , and @card@ healthy blood donor , @card@ male ( @card@ % ) , @card@ female ( @card@ % ) , median ( IQR ) age @card@ ( @card@ – @card@ ) year for SARS-COV-2 antibody . of the @card@ COVID-19 convalescent subject , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody . there be @card@ ( @card@ % ) COVID-19 convalescent subject that although positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasopharyngeal swab , do not develop humoral response and have no detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody within median ( IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) month after the infection . all healthy subject be negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody , with IgG level median ( @card@ IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) . in convalescent subject SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer distribution ( median and @card@ @card@ IQR ) by time from positive nasopharyngeal swab be show in Fig . 1 A ; the median ( @card@ IQR ) SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level by time from infection be present in Table 1 . time from positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab correlate with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level ( Pearson r=-0.281 , p<0.001 ) . there be a decline in the level of antibody by @card@ % within 6 month , however the level be still high above the positive cut-off ; thereafter , up to 9 month ' post-infection , antibody level stabilize and remain similar to that of the 6 month ' level . assess the effect of age , gender , blood type and clinical symptomatology on SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level demonstrate that in old subject ( >50 year , N=70 ) , the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody be high than in young subject ( <50 year , N=318 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) vs. @card@ ( @card@ ) , p<0.01 ; similarly , male subject ( N=284 ) have high antibody level compare to female ( N=108 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) vs. @card@ ( @card@ ) , p=0.015 . after adjustment for the time follow positive RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal swab no statistical difference relate to age and gender be find . of @card@ COVID-19 convalescent subject @card@ ( @card@ % ) recover from mild to severe disease , while @card@ ( @card@ % ) be asymptomatic subject that develop humoral IgG response without any clinical symptomatology . SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level do not differ between asymptomatic subject and symptomatic subject , @card@ ( @card@ ) vs. @card@ ( @card@ ) , p=0.57 . blood type analysis in @card@ convalescent COVID-19 subject disclose similar SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level between blood group as follow : type A ( N=124 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) ; Type O ( N=107 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) ; Type B ( N=52 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) ; Type AB ( N=23 ) , @card@ ( @card@ ) , p=0.11 . time related change stratify by age , gender and clinical symptomatology in relation to the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody be present in Fig . 1 B-D . @card@ repeated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurement be perform in COVID-19 convalescent subject , median ( @card@ IQR ) time to first IgG test @card@ ( @card@ ) month , and to the second IgG test @card@ ( @card@ ) month . in @card@ subject two serial measurement be perform and in @card@ COVID-19 convalescent subject three serial measurement be obtain ( Fig 2 A and 2B , respectively ) . in 9 of @card@ ( @card@ % ) subject with duplicate test , SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody decrease below the positive cut-off and they become negative within median ( @card@ IQR ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) month . all have a low baseline IgG SARS-COV2 antibody titer median ( @card@ IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) . similarly , in 3 of @card@ ( @card@ % ) subject with triplicate repeated test , SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody decrease below the positive cut-off , and their third test become negative within median ( @card@ IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) month . all have a low baseline titer median ( @card@ IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) . multivariate linear regression analysis disclose that the only variable that predict the decay of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody over time be the previous IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody level . the rate of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody decline over time be not affect by age , gender , or symptomatology . in a randomly select group of @card@ convalescent COVID-19 subject median ( @card@ IQR ) @card@ ( @card@ ) year , @card@ male , B cell memory response analyze 1 to 9 month post infection be detect in @card@ % of subject . there be no difference relate to SARS-CoV-2 IgG level , time post infection or age between subject with or without SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B-cell response . understand the pathway of immune regulation follow COVID-19 infection have important implication to recover patient and healthcare authority regard decision relate to safety behavior in daily life and the need for vaccination . our finding that @card@ % of COVID-19 convalescent subject do not develop IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody be in accordance with previous study [ @card@ ] . the failure of infected subject to mount an effective primary immune response can be attribute to false-positive RT-PCR result but can also suggest that , similarly to many other infection , some patient have immune barrier possibly relate to antigen capture that prevent a proper humoral response . further research be need to unveil factor that lead to such failure . our finding demonstrate long-lasting protective humoral immunity against COVID-19 by S1 IgG antibody in most COVID-19 convalescent subject . we use the Euroimmune Elisa assay to quantify SARS-COV-2 antibody level as it be report to highly correlate with the neutralize antibody assay [ @card@ ] . it be well know that high neutralize titer be particularly important for protection against the COVID-19 pandemic [ 8 ] . this immune response be sustain up to 9 month post-infection . the level of humoral protection be not affect by age , gender , blood type or , clinical symptomatology , as both asymptomatic and subject with mild to severe disease have develop immune response with similar level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody . although we observe a time-related antibody decline by @card@ % over a period of 9 month , the antibody level in most convalescent COVID-19 subject be still in the protective range and reach a sustained plateau at 6 month that remain stable up to 9 month post-infection . we find no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level between female and male convalescent subject over time . this finding be in agreement with a recent study that report no gender difference in @card@ COVID-19 recover patient follow the early post-infection period [ 9 ] , although a previous small study of @card@ COVID-19 convalescent subject with only 4 female report that the generation of IgG antibody be high in female in the disease early phase [ @card@ ] . it have be report that regardless of age , female tend to show great antibody response , high basal Ig level , and high B cell number than do male [ @card@ ] . however , these gender-related immune difference be not observe follow COVID-19 infection . [ @card@ ] . the absence of clinical symptomatology in COVID-19 infected subject be report to be associate with low virus-specific IgG level and a high rate of seroconversion in the early convalescent phase [ @card@ ] . our finding , in contrast , demonstrate that asymptomatic COVID-19 convalescent subject develop similar level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG to that of symptomatic subject , and the decline over time be similar in both group . a recent study report that there be no significant difference in anti-spike IgG titer by Abo blood group [ @card@ ] . similarly , we do not find any association between the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and blood group . previous study report low rate of seroconversion within the early period ( @card@ month ) post-infection , mainly in patient who have low IgG antibody from the beginning or be immunosuppressed [ @card@ ] . we find a high percentage of @card@ % and @card@ % of subject that become SARS-COV-2 IgG seronegative within 6 to 9 month post-infection , respectively . all have low SARS-COV-2 antibody level during the early 3 month ' post-infection phase , suggest that subject with a-priori low IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer be at risk to lose their humoral immunity . this antibody decay raise the question regard the longevity of the humoral response in convalescent subject and provide important datum regard health care decision relate to the magnitude of protective humoral immunity and the need for COVID-19 vaccination particularly recover subject with SARS-COV-2 antibody decay or absence of B-cell memory response . the absence of specific S1 spike antibody in the serum do not necessarily mean the absence of immune response . antibody titer might not be the only determine factor for judge the success of COVID-19 immunization . it be possible that memory B cell can operate and provide a secondary immune response during a future encounter with SARS-Cov-2 infection . another possibility be that patient who become negative for SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody may still have SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-cell [ @card@ ] . we fail to observe a correlation between circulate IgG titer and memory B cell number . we find SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B-cell response only in @card@ % of subject , regardless of IgG antibody level or the time post-infection . it be evident that COVID-19 convalescent subject that maintain both high SARS-CoV-2 antibody and memory B-cell be well protect from recurrent infection . subject that lose their antibody but still hold a memory B-cell response , be expect to have a mild disease when re-infected , as memory humoral immunity can provide long protection despite effector humoral decay . the problem remain regard convalescent subject that maintain SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in the absence of B-cell memory response . be it possible that serum antibody will persist in the absence of memory B-cells and provide life-long protection ? or should these group that comprise more than a third of convalescent subject need to be vaccinate despite prior COVID-19 infection ? be it possible that follow vaccination they will develop antigen-specific memory B-cells that will induce a long-lasting immune response ? the limitation of the study be the lack of longitudinal assessment for the majority of the subject as only @card@ ( @card@ % ) have serial sample . the interval between the two and three repeated antibody measurement in the same subject , though variable , add valuable datum to show a protective level up to 9 month post-infection . another limitation of the study be the missing knowledge regard the role of memory T-cell especially in patient that do not develop humoral immunity . our finding may help adopt COVID-19 vaccination strategy in relation to time post-infections and specifically regard subject that over time lose their circulate SARS-CoV-2 antibody response .

To approach this question , we assess individual multicenter datum from three cohort of COVID-19 patient treat during the first month of the pandemic in Germany . in order to assess consistency among region and increase generalizability of our finding , we then go on to pool our datum with publish datum of COVID-19 patient who be be treat in Wuhan and other region in China . in a retrospective multicenter study , consecutive patient ≥ @card@ year with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who have be admit to the three participate hospital ( University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden , Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH , Elblandklinikum Meißen ) in Saxony , Germany between March 1 and April @card@ , @card@ be select from the ongoing COVID-19 registry . location of participate hospital be illustrate in Fig . 1 . laboratory test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 include real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay ( RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit RUO , Altona Diagnostics , Hamburg , Germany ; Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay , Seegene Inc. , Seoul , Republic of Korea ; GeneFinderTM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp , Osang Healthcare Co. , Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea ) on respiratory specimen from nasal or oropharyngeal swab . we obtain datum on age , sex and vascular comorbidities include arterial hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , atrial fibrillation , coronary heart disease , tobacco use and past history of CVD . cerebrovascular disease be subdivide into ischemic stroke , transient ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage . we also review medical record and neuroimaging report from cranial compute tomography or magnetic resonance imaging study for evidence of previous clinically apparent or silent CVD . we detect one patient with evidence of previous lacunar stroke on cranial magnetic resonance imaging that be not diagnose history of CVD and decide to include this patient in our analysis . in order to assess the association of past history of CVD and risk of severe clinical course of COVID-19 , we aim to classify all patient in our multicenter cohort into “ severe ” and “ non-severe ” COVID-19 . however , previously publish approach to categorize severity of COVID-19 be find to be inconsistent and all together three different most frequently report approach could be identify . in order to achieve comparability of outcome datum with previously publish cohort , we separately apply these method to dichotomize our patient into severe and non-severe clinical course of the disease . first , we classify severity of COVID-19 in the patient of our multicenter cohort base on clinical parameter accord to the classification by the National Health Commission guideline on the diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . in this classification , “ mild ” be define as mild clinical symptom with no sign of pneumonia on chest imaging ; “ moderate ” as fever , respiratory symptom with radiologic sign of pneumonia ; “ severe ” as respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥ @card@ per minute and/or oxygen saturation at rest ≤ @card@ % and/or oxygenation index ≤ @card@ mmHg and/or progression of pulmonary lesion size > @card@ % within @card@ h , “ critical ” as respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation , hemodynamic shock , or any other organ failure with necessity of intensive care . we also categorize stage of disease by use the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients ( LEOSS ) definition , comprise the follow disease stage : “ uncomplicated ” , asymptomatic or symptom of upper respiratory tract infection , nausea , emesis , diarrhea , fever ; “ complicated ” , need for oxygen supplementation , partial arterial oxygen pressure at room air < @card@ mmHg , oxygen saturation at room air  5-fold upper limit normal , new cardiac arrhythmia , new pericardial effusion > 1 cm , new heart failure with pulmonary edema , congestive hepatopathy or peripheral edema ;

“ recovery ” , improvement by one phase and defervescence [ @card@ ] . second , severity of COVID-19 be also dichotomize for in-hospital death versus survival with death equal severe and survival indicate non-severe course . third , patient be classify into severe or non-severe clinical course of COVID-19 base on whether they require intensive care unit ( ICU ) treatment or undergo regular in-patient care until discharge . this systematic review and meta-analysis comply with the preferred Reporting item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) recommendation [ @card@ ] . we systematically search electronic database include MEDLINE ( access by PubMed ) , EMBASE and Cochrane Library for identification of all available observational study that report on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient age ≥18 year with information give on disease severity and past history of CVD . in addition , bibliography of identify full-text article and those of relevant review article be search manually . in order to be exhaustive , we limit our search on electronic database to search term “ COVID-19 ” with combination of associate medical subject heading ( MeSH ) “ COVID-2019 ” , “ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ” , “ 2019-nCoV ” , “ SARS-CoV-2 ” , “ 2019nCoV ” , “ Wuhan ” , “ coronavirus ” , “ @card@ ” . the complete search algorithm be provide in Online Resource 1 . our systematic search cover publication from the early date available until our last search date April @card@ , @card@ . no language or other restriction be impose . all identify article be screen use the follow eligibility criterion : ( 1 ) observational cohort consist of a minimum of five patient ≥ @card@ year who have be hospitalize for COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed by nasal or oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR ; ( 2 ) datum available on past history of CVD ; ( 3 ) categorization of COVID-19 severity accord to study-specific outcome definition . assessment of identify article involve three step : screen of title , abstract and full text by two independent reviewer ( T. S. and K. B. ) . any disagreement be resolve by consensus . abstract that do not provide sufficient information for analysis of methodology be subject to full-text evaluation . in case of miss information or any obscurity , the corresponding author of the identify article be contact for clarification . Two reviewer ( T. S. and K. B. ) independently extract datum on include study from the full-text article with insertion into a standardized data extraction form ( Excel , Microsoft , Redmond , Wa , USA ) . extract variable be first author , publication year , study design , sample size , demographic value , vascular comorbidities include history of CVD as well as definition of severity outcome of COVID-19 and respective absolute number of outcome event . we use the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Rating Scale to assess the quality of evidence in the include individual study [ @card@ ] . quality assessment be independently perform by two investigator ( T. S. and K. B. ) and disagreement be resolve by consensus . in the multicenter study , continuous and non-continuous variable be present as median with interquartile range ( IQR ) for skewed datum and percentage for proportional datum . Between-group comparison be perform use Chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test and Mann–Whitney U test , where applicable . Multivariable logistic regression be perform to explore the predictive value of history of CVD for severity outcome of COVID-19 include clinical severity accord to the classification by the National Health Commission guideline on the diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 , in-hospital death and necessity of intensive care [ @card@ ] . candidate variable be identify from the between-group comparison , whereas a p value of ≤ @card@ be use for covariate inclusion in the multivariable model . the final model be conduct use a backward selection procedure , whereas covariates with a p value <0.1 be remove from the model . in the quantitative data synthesis , risk ratio ( RR ) and their corresponding @card@ % confidence interval ( @card@ % CI ) for history of CVD be calculate from the absolute number of patient with severe and non-severe COVID-19 outcome as provide by each study . in our main analysis , we use a composite dichotomize outcome of severity subsume all severity outcome that be report by each of the include study comprise severity base on clinical parameter , in-hospital death versus survival and necessity of intensive care versus regular in-patient care . if include study classified severity outcome base on clinical parameter into more than two category ( e. g. , mild , moderate , severe , critical ) , those be subsume under severe ( i. e. , severe and critical ) and non-severe ( i. e. , mild and moderate ) category . thus , in our main analysis , all patient report in study identify from literature search cohort be classify into severe or non-severe COVID-19 base on the classification use by each study . with respect to our multicenter study , we choose to apply the approach of define severity by clinical parameter as recommend by the National Health Commission guideline on the diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 since this tend to be the most widely acknowledge method in the literature [ @card@ ] . continuity correction of @card@ be use for study with a zero cell [ @card@ ] . if a study report two or more zero-cell event , it be exclude from respective analysis . DerSimonian and Laird random effect model be use to compute the pooled RR for included study . [ @card@ ] in order to allow separate assessment of cluster of study with equal definition of COVID-19 in conjunction with our multicenter datum , sensitivity analysis be conduct for severity outcome . we cluster study that use the same approach to define severity and pool these datum with our multicenter datum by apply the same severity definition to our local cohort . analysis be carry out for three cluster of study : first , study define severity base on clinical parameter ; second , study define severity base on necessity of intensive care ; third , those define severity by in-hospital death . assume that only available case with complete datum on disease severity outcome be report in include study , pairwise deletion method be use to handle miss outcome datum . Between-study heterogeneity be assess use Cochran’s Q test and I2 statistic , where I2 value of 0–40 % indicate absent or low , 30–60 % moderate , 50–90 % substantial and 75–100 % considerable heterogeneity [ @card@ ] . significance level of heterogeneity be set at p < @card@ . publication bias be assess by visual inspection of funnel plot and Egger 's linear regression test . statistical significance be set at p < @card@ . all statistical analysis be conduct use Stata software package ( Version @card@ , StataCorp . , College Station , TX ) . during the observational period from March 1 to April @card@ , @card@ , @card@ patient ( @card@ % female , median age @card@ [ 55–78 ] ) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have be admit to participate hospital . Two patient be still hospitalize at the time of data analysis . overall , @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient show severe or critical clinical course with necessity of ICU treatment in @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient and in-hospital death in @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient . in the entire multicenter cohort , a history of CVD be evident in @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient with high frequency in patient with severe course of COVID-19 when apply the National Health Commission guideline on the diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 with dichotomize severity category subsume category mild , moderate in “ non-severe ” and category severe and critical into “ severe ” .

            " Covid-19 overlap with systemic sclerosis a 73-year-old woman with systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) sine scleroderma present with Raynaud 's phenomenon , esophageal motor disorder with significant dilation , and lung involvement characterize by usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) . Nailfold capillaroscopy reveal a scleroderma pattern . she have antinucleolar autoantibody . the patient be dehydrate , malnourished , admit to the emergency department , and not take any immunosuppressants at admission . real-time polymerase chain demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infection . a chest compute tomography ( CT ) reveal right low lobe consolidation and finding consistent with UIP-predominantly peripheral and basal interlobular septal thickening , reticulation , traction bronchiectasis , and honeycomb ( Figure 1A-C ) . a CT scan eight month prior show no consolidation ( figure 1D ) . in interstitial lung disease associate with SSc , the most common initiator be injury to alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cell ; inflammatory pathway activate profibrotic stimulus that produce vary degree of inflammation and fibrosis . the main interstitial pattern observe be nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and UIP , pattern of which may share some feature with Covid-19 pneumonia , such as ground-glass opacity , reticulation , and subpleural line 1 , 2 . CT finding of Covid-19 mainly include , subpleural and predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacity , a crazy-paving pattern , and/or consolidation with air bronchograms , usually with bilateral and multilobar involvement 3 . however , when a patient present with a pre-exist pathology ( such as UIP ) comparison with previous CT finding should be do to avoid miss a diagnosis of pulmonary involvement cause by SARS-CoV-2 infection . the presence of interstitial lung disease and ongoing immunosuppressive treatment may place patient with SSc at risk of develop more severe disease and high mortality when infect by SARS-CoV-2 2 .   a Hybrid Virtual Fracture Clinic be Safe and Efficacious in the COVID-19 Era : stay at Home and Save life in March @card@ , the World Health Organization ( who ) declare the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) viral infection as a pandemic cause by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV2 ) , belong to the coronaviridae family [ @card@ ] . since then , several country include the United Kingdom have suffer two or more wave of the pandemic , with many region across the world still grapple with a surge in infection . early review confirm the virus to be highly transmissible with a mortality rate between @card@ % and 2 % [ 3 ] . in the United Kingdom , social distancing guideline , lockdowns , and standard operate procedure be outline by the government and other organisation as infection rate and hospital admission of COVID-19 patient soar during March-April @card@ . the UK National Health Service ( NHS ) come under increase pressure , and the government issue the public message during the lockdown to ‘ Stay at Home . protect the NHS . Save live . ' the British Orthopaedic Association ( Boa ) issue clinical guideline for patient management use remote consultation [ 4 ] . these include deliver follow-up appointment by telephone or video call , and the non-operative treatment of fracture where possible , particularly for upper limb fracture . NHS guideline also specify patient who would not require physical examination or test , after carry out the risk assessment and exclude exception criterion [ 5 ] . keep in line with these guideline , virtual clinic be initiate and/or expand in various hospital in the United Kingdom . telephone consultation and virtual clinic be previously under practice and have be review in various study [ @card@ ] . the requirement to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of virtual clinic to face-to-face clinic be emphasise by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( Nice ) in @card@ [ 7 ] . the importance of virtual clinic in deliver healthcare to remote location be know . while previous study regard virtual fracture clinic have show these to be useful , effective , and more economical , they focus exclusively on remote consultation [ @card@ ] . however , the present pandemic necessitate the use of virtual clinic with the main aim of reduce patient footfall in hospital . the Trauma and Orthopaedics department at our institution start a ' hybrid virtual fracture clinic ' ( HVFC ) service that be bespeak to the patient - either a face-to-face or telephone consultation , or both , depend on the patient requirement . patient be inform regard the mode of consultation appropriate for their need , depend on their vulnerability to the coronavirus , orthopaedic condition , and any particular requirement for management of the same . in the present article , we review this HVFC model use objective patient satisfaction score and patient-reported outcome for this novel service . this be a retrospective study conduct at the outpatient department of a Level 1 Major Trauma Centre ( MTC ) in London . patient who be book to attend the fracture clinic service during the first two week of the national lockdown in the United Kingdom ( March @card@ , @card@ , to April 5 , @card@ ) during the coronavirus pandemic be include in the analysis . patient be contact and the study questionnaire be conduct by telephone by the author ( AS and MIB ) between June and July @card@ . verbal consent be obtain from all patient prior to the questionnaire . the study be register with the institution 's clinical audit department . Two follow-up phone-call attempt be make for unavailable patient . all patient over the age of @card@ year be include in the study . those less than @card@ year of age and those who do not attend ( DNA ) the appointment/were not contactable at the time of appointment , be exclude . in elderly patient or those with dementia , response from their primary carer be accept . we note the total number of virtual ( telephone ) and/or face-to-face consultation each patient attend up until the time of the questionnaire and use this datum to later differentiate patient who have only virtual , only face-to-face , or ‘ hybrid ' consultation . we also note the type of condition ( upper limb , low limb , or spine/pelvis/other ) , whether these patient be discharge from the HVFC or still under follow-up , and whether they require surgery as part of their treatment . we note the number of new patient , and how many of these have their first appointment within @card@ hour of their injury . patient be classify as vulnerable or non-vulnerable to COVID-19 base on the who criterion , take into account their age and medical co-morbidities . these criterion have also be publish and follow by the NHS [ 5 ] . patient experience of the HVFC be assess use a validate questionnaire , which include the net Promoter Score ( NPS ) , Customer Effort Score ( CES ) , and Customer Satisfaction Score ( CSS ) . these score be evaluate on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be the bad and @card@ be the well possible score . the NPS ask patient to rate their likelihood to recommend a service to a friend or colleague [ 8 ] . the CES be a single item metric that measure how much effort a customer/patient have to exert to get an issue resolve , a request fulfill , a service acquire or a question answer [ 9 ] . the CSS be a measurement of overall customer/patient satisfaction with a certain service or product [ @card@ ] . moreover , patient be also ask about the likelihood of their use the HVFC format in the absence of a pandemic , and score this on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be not likely at all , and @card@ be extremely likely . Patient-reported outcome be assess use the validate EuroQol Group 5D-5L ( EQ-5D-5L ) score , consist of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the Eq Visual Analogue Scale ( EQ-VAS ) . the descriptive part include question about the patient ' ease of mobility , self-care , routine activity , pain/discomfort , and anxiety or depression . the EQ-VAS require patient to score their own health on a scale of @card@ , with 1 be the bad and @card@ be the well possible health [ @card@ ] . the anonymity of all the recorded datum be ensure during its processing and electronic analysis . Data entry be do in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the final analysis be do use Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) software ( IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version @card@ . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp ) . the comparison of the net promoter score , customer effort score , customer satisfaction score , and self-rated EQ-VAS score between different mode of consultation be do use the Kruskal Wallis test . comparison of the descriptive component of the EQ-5D-5L ( which be qualitative parameter ) be analyse use the Fisher’s exact test . a p-value of less than @card@ be consider significant . of @card@ possible adult age group patient that attend the HVFC during the study period , @card@ patient respond to the telephone call and the questionnaire . of these , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be male while @card@ ( @card@ % ) be female . the mean age be @card@ year ( range @card@ year ) . table 1 show the distribution of patient base on vulnerability to COVID-19 , surgical or non-surgical management , and follow-up status at the time of the questionnaire . patient with low limb condition constitute the majority of those in HVFC ( Figure 1 ) . the mean NPS , CES , and CSS of the hybrid virtual fracture clinic score on a scale of @card@ be @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ , respectively . the mean likelihood of use the HVFC in the absence of a pandemic be @card@ ( Table 2 ) . there be @card@ new patient refer from the accident and emergency department , of which @card@ ( @card@ % ) have their first consultation within @card@ hour . there be @card@ consultation , of which @card@ be conduct virtually , save @card@ ( @card@ % ) hospital visit . overall , @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) have only face-to-face consultation , @card@ ( @card@ % ) have only virtual consultation , while @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) have hybrid consultation ( Figure 2 ) . a Kruskal Wallis test be do to compare the outcome of different mode of consultation ( face-to-face , hybrid , and virtual ) . there be no statistically significant difference across NPS , CES , CSS , or EQ-VAS rating between the group ( Table 3 ) . patient who have hybrid consultation tend to report good NPS , CES , and EQ-VAS score than those who have virtual consultation only , although this difference do not reach statistical significance . patient with face-to-face consultation have the high mean NPS of @card@ ( Figure 3 ) . patient in the vulnerable group tend to report well overall mean score than the non-vulnerable group include a high mean EQ-VAS health score , but this difference do not reach statistical significance ( p = @card@ ) ( Figure 4 ) . patient who require surgery as part of their treatment report bad overall mean score than those who do not , although this difference do not reach statistical significance ( Table 4 ) . there be a significant difference in the pain component rating of the EQ-5D-5L , with surgical patient report high pain level compare to patient manage non-surgically ( p = @card@ ) . patient who do not require surgery tend to report increase customer satisfaction score , as represent in the Box-Whisker plot ( Figure 5 ) . patient already discharge from the service report high overall mean score include a high EQ-VAS ( Table 4 ) . there be a significant difference between the pain component of EQ-5D-5L , with patient still under follow-up report high pain level ( p < @card@ ) . patient who be still under follow-up also report significantly high anxiety level compare to those discharge ( p = @card@ ) on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire . the NHS be face increase pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic , affect the delivery of all service , include orthopaedic fracture clinic . the pandemic have highlight the significance of remote consultation to reduce hospital visit and have lead to newfound practice with a fresh interest in the efficiency and efficacy of virtual clinic across all specialty . the give circumstance result in the Boa recommend only unavoidable patient-initiated follow-up in fracture clinic through new guideline during the pandemic [ 4 ] . the need to protect the vulnerable group from COVID-19 exposure hold particular importance while plan virtual clinic . in our hospital , this need , combine with the need to reduce overall patient footfall , result in the formulation of the hybrid virtual fracture clinic . previous study have suggest high satisfaction ratio and acceptance of virtual fracture clinic among patient ; however , all of these have focus solely on virtual consultation [ 7 ] . To the good of our knowledge , no previous study have evaluate the outcome and patient satisfaction with a hybrid format of the clinic . the hybrid virtual fracture clinic ( HVFC ) format be bespeak to patient need - combine virtual and face-to-face consultation as appropriate for management . our result indicate that patient satisfaction and clinical outcome with virtual and hybrid format of consultation be similar to those with traditional face-to-face consultation . also , patient with at least one face-to-face consultation in combination with virtual consultation , tend to have good satisfaction and outcome score than those with only virtual consultation . patient vulnerable to COVID-19 have report excellent outcome across all measure in our study . their superior satisfaction score compare to non-vulnerable patient , highlight their recognition of the HVFC enable them to isolate themselves at home while be provide effective outpatient care . our result also show that patient with orthopaedic condition not require surgery may be most suit to this hybrid format , as such patient tend to report good satisfaction and clinical outcome measure compare to those require surgical management . the relatively low satisfaction score in surgical patient may partly be due to high pain level , as highlight by the significantly high rating of the pain component of EQ-5D-5L in patient require surgery . the HVFC have the significant benefit of minimize hospital visit of patient vulnerable to COVID-19 while continue to provide clinical outcome comparable to face-to-face consultation . our result show that with this hybrid format , we be able to reduce footfall by @card@ % , with equivalent patient satisfaction and outcome . the HVFC format could provide an efficient and economical model for conduct fracture clinic in the future , reduce the burden of face-to-face consultation . another important benefit of the HVFC be reduce travel , especially in the current era of climate change , with a huge emphasis be on promote sustainable healthcare . there be a drive towards devise strategy to make the NHS and surgical practice overall , more environment friendly [ @card@ ] . the HVFC format , reduce travel to clinic appointment by over @card@ % , while provide efficient outpatient care , can certainly help promote this . technological advance have highly enable televidimedicine [ @card@ ] and virtual clinic have be study in the past regard their outreach to remote location , and their economical benefit [ @card@ ] . virtual fracture clinic ( VFCs ) have be initiate in the United Kingdom previously with the intention to meet the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma ( Boast ) guideline that require a trauma patient to be review at a fracture clinic within @card@ hour of present to the emergency department , and have be find to be in compliance with this guideline [ @card@ ] . we attribute our low compliance to this guideline , to the timing of our study at the commencement of lockdown , and re-organisation of clinic list during this period , result in a delay in new appointment . potential cost reduction be another benefit of an HVFC model . the Glasgow Fracture Pathway conclude a cost save of approximately @card@ % use virtual consultation [ @card@ ] . similarly , McKirdy and Imbuldeniya conclude that an amount of @card@ GBP be conserve within the first year of implementation of virtual clinic , and predict to save approximately @card@ GBP every year after that [ 7 ] . also , the incorporation of virtual consultation can increase the overall capacity of the fracture clinic . Logishetty and Subramanyam show a rise of 8 % in the total outpatient fracture appointment after the implementation of a virtual fracture clinic [ @card@ ] . Rhind et al . do a literature review that indicate the advantage of merge VFCs and face-to-face consultation . in their review , @card@ % of patient be satisfy after VFC consultation . a decrease in non-attendance of almost @card@ % be note . they also note that VFCs do not impede the training and education of trainee [ @card@ ] . as we include patient with vary orthopaedic condition , we be unable to comment , from our result , on whether patient with certain condition may fare good with the HVFC than other . however , previous study on VFCs have show their effectiveness for the management of a number of orthopaedic injury not require surgical intervention . these include patient with simple radial head fracture , little finger metacarpal fracture , fifth metatarsal fracture , and buckle fracture in child [ @card@ ] . Bhattacharya et al . find that patient with undisplaced clavicle fracture can be discharge after a single virtual consultation with good patient outcome and satisfaction [ @card@ ] . similarly , the Boa COVID guideline now encourage early definitive management of such injury with virtual/patient-initiated follow-up , in order to minimise subsequent visit to the fracture clinic [ 4 ] . previous VFCs have be show to have good outcome in term of patient satisfaction . in the study by Hawarden et al . , the VFC be think to be good or excellent by @card@ % of responder . Ninty-seven percent respond that they would be likely or extremely likely to suggest the VFC to family member or friend [ @card@ ] . Jayram et al . show satisfaction range from @card@ % to @card@ % in patient with radial head or neck fracture manage solely with virtual consultation [ @card@ ] . the HVFC format reduce patient footfall significantly ( >50 % ) while provide effective and satisfactory outpatient care during the first COVID-19 wave . there be no difference in patient-reported outcome between face-to-face consultation , hybrid , or virtual consultation thus show that the HVFC be a safe and efficacious method for outpatient management of orthopaedic trauma , in line with Boa guideline . patient would recommend this service to other , they find it easy to use and report a good experience . it enable patient to stay at home , which in turn ease pressure on public healthcare , which could , in turn , save life in keep with United Kingdom public health promotion .   analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on house-staff in the USA : address the ripple effect the COVID-19 ( Corona Virus Disease-19 ) pandemic have place unprecedented demand on healthcare worker around the world , and their response to the challenge have be both courageous and inspiring . unfortunately , front-line healthcare worker have be negatively impact in several way . firstly , lack of personal protective equipment have lead to anxiety and concern amongst physician regard not just their own safety , but also the safety of their family and love one [ @card@ ] . secondly , observe first-hand the toll that the pandemic have take on their community , include sometimes their own colleague have negatively affect the mental well-being of healthcare worker [ 3 ] . finally , and most devastatingly , thousand of physician world-wide have lose their life in the fight against COVID-19 [ 4 ] . many training program have try to limit exposure to COVID ( + ) patient for house officer , but nonetheless resident physician have experience the same stressors as more senior colleague . they have suffer anxiety due to a lack of PPE and mental distress from observe the serious impact of of the pandemic on their community [ 5 ] . despite duty hour restriction , resident report that shift during the pandemic have be more rigorous [ 6 ] . educational activity have take a back seat due to increase workload and social distancing , elective rotation have be cancel , and there have be a reduce focus on outpatient care , all of which have culminate in a more labor-intensive experience [ 7 ] . these change have not only affect the personal life and well-being of house officer just as they have every other frontline worker , but they have also suddenly and dramatically change the face of residency training . we conduct a cross-sectional survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on the life and training of resident physician from April to June @card@ . the survey be disseminate via e-mails and social medium . initial question be yes/no , and design to assess the overall impact of the pandemic on resident physician ' life and training . next , resident be ask to rate , on a scale of 1 to @card@ , the degree to which they be concern about particular issue ( question 1 to @card@ ) and the degree to which their well-being be affect ( question @card@ to @card@ ) . response be categorize as ‘ not significantly [ 1–4 ] ' , ‘ somewhat significantly [ 5–7 ] ' and ‘ significantly [ 8–10 ] . ' the statistical analysis be perform use R software v @card@ . feel significantly overwhelm by the pandemic be not associate with direct involvement in the care of confirm or suspect COVID-19 case ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) or have dependent to take care of at home ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . paradoxically , house-staff with underlie chronic medical problem be actually less likely than their healthy colleague to report be significantly overwhelmed ( R = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . table 1 show a quantitative analysis of the response from house-staff . resident who report the high level of concern about their ability to take care of their patient do not report increase level of concern about paranoia among patient ( p < @card@ ) , lack of communication from authority ( p < @card@ ) or lack of personal knowledge or understanding regard COVID-19 ( p = @card@ ) . those who have the high level of concern about the availability of PPE or increase patient load do not report an increase in concern about their ability to take care of patient ( p = @card@ ) . resident who be somewhat concern about the lack of protective equipment be , not surprisingly , significantly concern about their ability to protect themselves from the infection ( p < @card@ ) . there be three group of resident most likely to report that the pandemic have impact both their physical and mental health : house-officers feeling overwhelm by the pandemic ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ and physical health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ ) , those concerned about their ability to safeguard themselves from COVID-19 ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ and physical health χ2 = @card@ , p < @card@ ) , and finally , those who be concern about be able to take care of their family and love one ( mental health – χ2 = @card@ , p = @card@ and physical health χ2 = @card@ , p = @card@ ) . the final question be a free text and offer participant the opportunity to share any positive change they have witness . about @card@ % respondent leave comment , and the content vary widely . Two general theme do emerge . about @card@ % of respondent be please with the unity and camaraderie amongst co-worker and colleague . about @card@ % respondent be happy with the pro-activeness of their hospital or program in deal with the crisis . roughly @card@ % respondent state that they do not witness any positive change in the current time . the current survey be limit by its small sample size . we send out the survey when hospital across the state be deal with high patient volume and therefore most resident be likely unable to respond to survey in a timely manner due to patient care-related responsibility . our current sample size represent <1 % of the resident physician training across the nation . also , presumably most of the respondent belong to internal medicine residency program in our analysis , which make the study sample less representative of resident physician from other specialty . gradual variation in local government rule relate to lockdown may have also affect the stress level among resident train in those state , which would also have affectedthe result of our survey . since the pandemic impacted state in wave , a follow-up of current response would help capture the overall impact of the pandemic on resident in a more thorough manner . it be also possible that we be not able to capture response from resident who be on busy rotation at the time the survey be send out . this may have lead to some underestimation of the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . there may also have be some selection bias , in that those resident who have strong feeling about the effect of the pandemic would be more likely to respond to the survey . the result of our survey indicate that the overall well-being of trainee have be significantly affect by the ongoing pandemic . rapid implementation by residency program and hospital of measure to ensure the mental and physical well-being of resident be need on multiple level . first and foremost , the importance of adequate personal protective equipment can be overstate . there be also a need for community support to ensure safe care for child and elderly family member of all frontline worker , include house officer . on the positive side , resident have acknowledge that they have come closer to their colleague and co-worker in these time and have appreciate the preparedness of their respective hospital in deal with the pandemic . again , it be worth mention that feeling overwhelm by the pandemic be independent of be directly involve in the care of COVID-19 patient . such a phenomenon could be relate to the vicarious trauma suffer by some resident who feel extreme sympathy for COVID-19 patient and other physician who be work directly with them [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] . regardless of the cause , mental or physical health-based intervention should target resident irrespective of their direct involvement in the care of infected patient and should be initiate immediately . timely intervention to regularize work responsibility , provide adequate protection and safety to house-staff and ensure their overall well-being in these unusually challenging time will go a long way in define the future of healthcare both nationally and worldwide .   towards Quantitative and Standardized Serological and Neutralization Assays for COVID-19 the global response to COVID-19 have spur innovation in diagnostic , surveillance , and vaccine development at an unprecedented pace . robust and quantitative serological and neutralization assay be key measurement for assess the complex patient response to SARS-CoV-2 , the coronavirus that cause COVID-19 [ 1 ] . for example , serological assay be critical for measure the individual and the population exposure to COVID-19 . mild and asymptomatic case constitute the majority of infection [ 2 ] , and reliable serological assay be need to determine the seroprevalence as well as full geographical dispersion of people who carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus . rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody have be recognize as an invaluable tool in track and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 3 ] . in the context of overall hospital operation , reliable and convenient serologic assay could play a significant role in establish the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment scale to guide the treatment of exist illness in old patient , for example toxicity risk of chemotherapy in cancer ward [ 4 ] . the assay could also provide datum during triage prior to patient admittance and minimize spread of COVID-19 among the hospital health worker [ 5 ] . serological assay be also fundamental for the measurement of complex humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 . moreover , serological assay will have an increase role to evaluate the efficacy and durability of various COVID-19 vaccine now available or soon to be available . however , current serology result be highly variable [ 6 ] , in part due to a lack of well characterize , globally traceable reference material need for assay validation and control . as a part of the hierarchy of the global standardization of serologic testing , a robust , quantitative reference assay be urgently need to support various response to the pandemic . the ideal serological assay detect and quantify viral specific antibody in the blood serum or plasma from a previously infected person [ 7 ] . the assay generally involve immobilize specific viral epitopes that bind viral specific antibody onto a substrate . upon exposure to a blood sample , the substrate bound , viral specific antibody be measure . example of such serological assay include Elisa [ 8 ] , luminescence kit [ 9 ] , and immunochromatographic card [ @card@ ] . up to now , several SARS-CoV2 serology assay , e. g. , Roche’s Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay , have win FDA EUA approval as semi-quantitative serology assay . however , for serology assay to be truly quantitative , universal high quality reference antibody standard be require to enable assay quantification and standardization . in vitro neutralization assay can help to assess the ability of neutralize antibody ( Nab ) present in serum or plasma to inhibit cell binding or block entry into the person’s cell . neutralize antibody be characterize by their exceptional affinity to the viral epitopes generally involve in viral cell entry . for SARS-CoV-2 , the viral infection occur largely mediate by the receptor bind domain ( RBD ) , a part of the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein [ @card@ ] , which bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor on the human cell and facilitate cell entry . antibody against the RBD be highly correlative with neutralize activity [ @card@ ] . this have spur the development of antibody panel design to bind RBD and other epitopes in its vicinity [ @card@ ] . conventional virus neutralization assay require the handling of live/active SARS-CoV-2 in a specialized biosafety level 3 ( BSL3 ) containment facility and be time-consuming ( 2–4 day to complete ) and labor intensive [ @card@ ] . recently develop pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay can be perform in a BSL2 facility [ @card@ ] ; however , these assay still require the use of live virus and cell . surrogate neutralization assay that require no live virus and cell and that can yield result in a few hour in a BSL2 laboratory have be develop [ @card@ ] . good correlation between conventional virus , pseudovirus , and surrogate neutralization assay have be show [ @card@ ] . clearly , BSL-3 sparing , rapid neutralization assay that be high throughput ready and scalable be in demand for assess the efficacy and durability of vaccine [ @card@ ] . this manuscript describe a novel and quantitative flow cytometry-based assay utilize microsphere ( also call bead or microbeads in the following ) with immobilize antigen that capture antibody specific to SARS-COV-2 . the spike and RBD antigen be immobilize on two bead population with distinct fluorescence address . fluorescent phycoerythrin ( PE)-labeled secondary antibody be use to detect the presence of the capture antibody on the surface of the bead . the use of an RBD specific reference IgG standard enable the quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer in patient sample . a sensitive surrogate flow cytometry-based neutralization assay utilize microbeads couple with RBD and biotinylated ACE2 protein be develop . significant correlation between the result obtain from serological RBD IgG assay and surrogate neutralization assay be observe . as part of the effort to optimize assay performance , three different type of microbeads be evaluate to select the most appropriate bead . the selection criterion include bead that provide the high signal-to-noise , low microbead aggregation , and consideration with respect to the ease of use for the overall assay workflow . the same number of MagPlex-Avidin , SeroMap , or MagPlex-C microbeads be conjugate with the same amount of a RBD ( Ragon ) . Mab S562-109 spike in a negative serum ( Nist SRM 909c ) and positive plasma control ( NIBSC convalescent plasma code : @card@ ) dilute in PBT buffer serve as the two positive control . as show in Figure 1A , signal-to-noise ratio from MagPlex-Avidin microsphere be the low from both positive control and thus eliminate . the signal-to-noise ratio from SeroMap bead be high from the positive plasma control , but low from the Mab S562-109 positive control when compare to the MagPlex-C bead . as MagPlex-C bead be dope with a magnetic material , which facilitate various washing step require by the assay , they be choose as the substrate on which all subsequent serological assay be perform . next , we optimize the amount of antigenic protein conjugate to the microbeads for each protein in order to achieve the high sensitivity . Figure 1B illustrate the signal-to-noise ratio for microbeads conjugate with different amount of spike antigen against anti-spike IgG in the positive plasma control . different dilution of the positive plasma control , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , with respect to the same dilution of the negative serum SRM 909c as the assay background be evaluate . the high signal-to-noise ratio come from MagPlex-C conjugate with @card@ µg of spike protein ; therefore , this formulation be select for the measurement of anti-spike IgG in all subsequent serological assay . the same optimization strategy be apply to all other viral antigen . as a result , @card@ µg of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , 5 µg of SARS-CoV-2 RBD , @card@ µg of MERS , @card@ µg of SARS , @card@ µg of OCT43 , or @card@ µg of HKU1 be couple to @card@ × @card@ MagPlex-C bead with a spectrally distinct region for each viral antigen for optimize performance and to enable multiplex ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . To further improve assay performance , viral antigen from different source be evaluate . specially , the signal-to-noise ratio from bead immobilize with RBD from two source and spike antigen from two source be evaluate use both positive control . Ragon’s RBD and VRC’s spike be select as the antigen for all subsequent assay . the limit-of-detection ( Lod ) be determine by analyze a training sample set which consist of a know number of positive and negative sample . figure 2 show the logarithmic MFI ( log10 MFI ) value for the four SARS-CoV-2 serological assay : RBD IgG assay ( A ) , spike IgG assay ( B ) , RBD IgM assay ( C ) , and spike IgM assay ( D ) . note that the IgG and IgM assay be run in a duplexed format , with both RBD and spike coated bead in a sample well , to increase the throughput . we compute the sample mean and sample standard-deviation ( SD ) of log-transformed MFI value for negative sample and define the Lod ( black horizontal line ) as this mean + 3s . the LODs at various sample dilution for the four assay be summarize in Table 1 . in all case , the Lod improve at high sample dilution . additionally , high LODs be obtain for the RBD IgM assay , likely due to non-specific interference from other immunoglobins present in the sample include other non-SARS-CoV-2 antibody . the assay’s sensitivity and specificity be evaluate in term of its ability to correctly identify positive and negative sample from a set of @card@ blind sample consist both positive ( sample from patient who have have a positive PCR result for COVID-19 ) and negative ( healthy donor sample from pre-pandemic ) from two separate evaluation study . figure 3 show highly correlate logarithmic MFI value of anti-RBD versus value of anti-spike at the @card@ sample dilution for IgG assay ( A ) and IgM assay ( B ) , respectively . sample fall to the left of or below the Lod green line be consider to be negative , whereas sample fall outside of this region be consider to be positive . use the current Lod method , we observe a false positive IgG serology result ( blue circle ) on a negative training sample and a false negative IgM serology result ( red cross ) on a positive training sample . the discrepancy between serology and PCR result be not unexpected as the presence and concentration of various biomarkers be highly dependent on the timing of the sample collection with respect to viral exposure/infection [ @card@ ] . the Lod method be apply to the blind sample ( black diamond ) to assess assay sensitivity , specificity , and prevalence [ @card@ ] . base on this set of sample , the sensitivity and specificity of our serological IgG assay be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively . for the IgM assay , the sensitivity and specificity be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively . as note above , the assay sensitivity determine use the Lod method be highly dependent on the training sample . the result further highlight the need for standard and reference controls/reference material with different level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to enable comparison of assay performance across different assay format and harmonization of assay result . the cross reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay be evaluate use four human coronaviruses ( accessible to us at the time of assay development ) , SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV . both IgG and IgM assay be conduct in a quadruple fashion , enable by utilize four different microbeads of different fluorescence intensity address , each pair with a different coronaviral antigen ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . a sequence alignment of these five human coronavirus spike protein be provide as the Supplementary Materials . for both IgG and IgM assay , we observe no linear correlation between SARS-CoV-2 spike and the other four coronavirus spike antigen investigate . in addition , interference from both SARS and MERS in both IgG and IgM assay at the @card@ sample dilution be negligible as show in Figure 4 . on the other hand , many negative sample exhibit high titer of anti-OC43 and anti-HKU1 IgG . among the common cold coronaviruses , the anti-OC43 antibody titer be much high than those of anti-HKU1 , indicative of potential noncorrelative interference . these result be not surprising because the two common cold virus be widespread in the general population . To enable quantification of IgG , we establish a calibration curve use a mAb of know concentration against SARS-CoV RBD that be available and exhibit strong binding affinity to RBD . the calibration curve be then use to determine the concentration of IgG in the patient sample . Mab S562-109 be use as the IgG reference control in the generation of the calibration curve ( Figure 5 ) . specifically , reference solution with different concentration of Mab S562-109 be use to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen immobilize on the MagPlex-C bead . the binding reaction lead to equilibrium MFI value of the RBD IgG assay at each concentration of Mab S562-109 . as Mab S562-109 concentration increase , the MFI value of the RBD assay increase . the MFI value reach a plateau when the concentration of Mab S562-109 be sufficiently high to saturate the binding to accessible and immobilize RBD antigen . the binding affinity between the Mab S562-109 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD be sufficiently high ( private communication with Dr. Corbett at NIAID , NIH ) that at low concentration all mAb S562-109 in buffer solution be bind to the RBD antigen on the bead . we validate this assumption via high concentration of PE-labeled , secondary anti-human IgG Fc , which be use to ensure the detection of all mAb S562-109 bind to the bead surface . as note earlier , we assume that the binding reaction between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody in patient sample and the immobilize RBD antigen on the bead surface to be the same as that from the generation of the calibration curve . use this scheme , the measured MFI value enable the quantification of anti-RBD antibody titer in patient sample . as a rule of thumb , the linear range of the calibration curve ( @card@ to @card@ ng/mL , grey line ) be preferentially use to compute the anti-RBD antibody titer due to the high measurement confidence . for sample with MFI value outside of the linear calibration range , a logistic calibration curve give by Equation ( 1 ) ( orange line ) be utilize to calculate the antibody titer . the titer of some of the convalescent patient sample be display on the x-axis in Figure 6 . the error bar around the datum point be combined uncertainty estimate from sample replicate and the fitting procedure . the presence of NAbs be determine via the surrogate assay by quantify binding between RBD and biotinylated ACE2 protein in suspension . the binding reaction be recognize by the PE fluorescence signal after the addition of streptavidin-PE conjugate . in the absence of Nab , all RBD on the bead surface be bind to ACE2 and detect by fluorescence signal from the PE molecule . in the presence of Nab , on the other hand , the RBD/ACE2 binding be reduce due to competition with RBD/NAb binding , which result in a reduce pe fluorescence signal . the percentage of signal reduction due to the presence of Nab be calculate with respective to the signal obtain at the high sample dilution in which the amount of Nab be negligible . as a result , a curve of sample dilution vs. signal reduction % be generate ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . NT50 , the neutralization antibody titer and sample dilution at which @card@ % of the RBD site be occupy by Nab , be determine through curve fit to Equation ( 4 ) . the NT50 value of the convalescent patient sample be exhibit on the y-axis in Figure 6 along with error bar around the data point display uncertainty estimate from sample replicate and curve fitting procedure . several COVID-19 serological assay have be develop and report recently use the Luminex platform , although none have be demonstrate to be quantitative [ @card@ ] . while our serological assay utilize the MagPlex-C bead commonly use on the Luminex platform , our assay use the flow cytometry platform instead of more specialized Luminex equipment . hence , the assay may be more easily implement in different center as flow cytometry platform be widely available . additionally , flow cytometry afford us the ability to improve and optimize the assay performance base on the measurement target more rapidly . for example , as show in Figure 1A , while the signal-to-noise ratio from the SeroMap bead be high than that from the MagPlex-C bead , a detailed examination clearly show that the percentage of RBD-coupled SeroMap bead doublet be more than twice the percentage of RBD-coupled MagPlex-C bead doublet . although the bead doublet be typically gat out in the Luminex assay , the presence of doublet introduce bias in the quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody due to the exclusion of a significant number of antibody bind to bead doublet . moreover , the use of MagPlex-C bead facilitate essential washing step require by high confidence serological assay . with available antigen of anti-SARS-CoV-2 variant [ @card@ ] , the developed microbead conjugation protocol be currently apply for the development of serology assay for the viral variant such as B.1.351 lineage from South Africa . the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay be evaluate use four other human coronaviruses : SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV . a high variability in the sequence of the spike protein in the S1 and RBD domain of these coronavirus ( Supplementary Materials ) suggest that antibody generate against these two domain will be highly subtype specific . conversely , the S2 domain of the spike protein sequence be highly conserve across the human coronaviruses , indicative of potential increase cross reactivity [ @card@ ] . as show in Figure 4 , interference from SARS1 and MERS in both IgG and IgM assay be negligible at the @card@ sample dilution . at the same sample dilution , a significant portion of sample exhibit high titer of anti-OC43 and anti-HKU1 IgG . the anti-OC43 antibody titer be high than those of anti-HKU1 and , in some case , be similar in magnitude as those of anti-SARS-CoV-2 . similar observation have be report [ @card@ ] . our non-SARS-CoV-2 serology assay be run in a quadruple manner and therefore require less assay time and sample volume than a typical Elisa assay [ @card@ ] . Two other common coronaviruses , 229E-CoV and NL63-CoV [ @card@ ] may also exhibit some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 . however , they be not include in the present study since we be unable to obtain their viral spike protein . SARS-CoV-2 have cause a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-exist cross-reactive antibody to S2 domain and nucleocapsid protein in most individual [ @card@ ] . this observation be consistent with the idea that RBD and S1 domain be more likely to generate subtype-specific serological test for population surveillance of infection and humoral response monitoring of vaccination . To our knowledge , a high-quality serological reference standard do not yet exist for absolute quantification of various antibody against SARS-CoV-2 . in this study , we use Mab S562-109 , an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV as the reference standard for the quantification of anti-RBD IgG titer . a calibration curve be generate use mAb S562-109 spike in negative serum Nist SRM 909c . use this calibration curve , we be able to quantify the anti-RBD IgG titer of convalescent patient sample over a large concentration span three order of magnitude ( @card@ µg/mL to @card@ ng/mL ) . quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer be report use Elisa and a commercial anti-RBD monoclonal IgG [ @card@ ] . though no quantification detail be provide , the report show that the anti-RBD antibody titer in the same range from approximately @card@ µg/mL to @card@ ng/mL . our assay be able to detect RBD IgG titer nearly four time lower those determine by Elisa , demonstrate relatively high sensitivity of our flow cytometry base anti-RBD IgG assay . in this study , we develop a sensitive surrogate neutralization assay use RBD-coupled MagPlex-C bead and biotinylated ACE2 protein . in a large interlaboratory study in which we have participate [ @card@ ] , this surrogate neutralization assay be able to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD neutralize antibody on blind test sample with very low serological antibody titer ( <31.0 ng/mL ) with which our anti-RBD and spike serological assay could not determine positivity ( one of the black diamond show in the negative region of the IgG assay plot in Figure 3 ) . the neutralization assay can further complement the serological anti-RBD IgG assay for enhanced assay sensitivity . furthermore , a good correlation between the NT50 determine via surrogate neutralization assay and anti-RBD IgG titer obtain from the quantitative serological RBD IgG assay be show in Figure 6 . the high the anti-RBD IgG titer , the large the NT50 , consistent with the presence of increase neutralize anti-RBD antibody in the sample . a similar correlation be also observe when compare result of ELISA-based surrogate neutralization assay and serological anti-RBD assay [ @card@ ] . we observe an outlier sample display exceedingly high NT50 and rather low anti-RBD IgG titer . further examination of this sample reveal a high anti-RBD IgM titer , suggest that the majority neutralize antibody in this sample be of the IgM isotype . these finding highlight the need for robust orthogonal assay to provide a more holistic understanding of seroprevalence and complex patient response to SARS-CoV-2 infection . the proof-of-concept approach towards quantitative serology demonstrate here will enable comparison and standardization of serology assay result from different commercial and laboratory develop assay . if anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal IgG also have a neutralization effect , it can serve as a benchmark for standardize various neutralization assay . we be currently work with commercial manufacturer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal IgG and other US government agency for the identification of suitable reference IgG preparation through an interlaboratory study . a full length spike protein and two RBD antigen be produce use DNA plasmids , VRC-SARS-CoV-2 S-2P-3C-His8-Strep2 × 2 , Ragon-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD(319-529)-3C-His8-SBP ) , and Kram-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD(319-541)-His6 , respectively [ @card@ ] . another SARS-CoV-2 S1 ( CFAR #100979 ) be obtain from NIBSC , Hertfordshire , UK . a sequence schematic of the four SARS-CoV-2 antigen relative to the NCBI full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [ 9 ] be provide in Figure 7 with difference in sequence note for each protein . spike protein for SARS-CoV , MERS-CoV , OC43-CoV , and HKU1-CoV be also make in the laboratory use DNA plasmids generously provide by Drs.

Biotinylation of the Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein be carry out use an EZ-Link Micro NHS-PEG4-Biotinylation Kit from Thermo Fisher ( Rockford , Il , USA ) . @card@ µL of biotinylated Ragon RBD protein at a concentration of @card@ mg/mL be add to a 1 × @card@ MagPlex-Avidin bead suspend in a @card@ µL of assay buffer ( PBS with 1 % BSA ) and incubate for @card@ min on a rotator at room temperature . the reaction vessel be place into a magnet separator to perform two wash with @card@ mL of a block buffer , PBS with @card@ % Tween @card@ , 1 % BSA and @card@ % sodium azide ( PBS-TBN ) . finally , the RBD coated MagPlex-Avidin bead be resuspended in @card@ mL of PBS-TBN and store at 2–8 °C in the dark . Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein be couple to both SeroMap and MagPlex-C bead use xMAP Antibody Coupling ( Abc ) Kit ( Luminex , TX , USA ) . Prior to coupling , @card@ × @card@ bead be wash twice use @card@ µL of the Abc kit activation buffer . after the wash step , bead be resuspended in @card@ µL activation buffer and activate use a @card@ µL of EDC ( 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl ] carbodiimide hydrochloride ) . this reaction be stabilize by add a @card@ µL of Sulfo-NHS ( N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ) and incubate at room temperature for @card@ min on a rotator protect from light . bead be then wash 3 time use @card@ µL of the activation buffer and resuspended in @card@ µL of the activation buffer contain 5 µg of RBD and incubate at room temperature for 2 hrs . on a rotator protect from light . the coated bead be wash 3 time use the kit wash buffer and store in 1 mL washing buffer at 2–8 °C until need . assessment of serology assay performance with Ragon SARS-CoV-2 RBD coated MagPlex-Avidin , SeroMap , and MagPlex-C bead be carry out use negative serum Nist SRM 909c , RBD Mab S562-109 spike in the serum SRM 909c , and NIBSC’s SRAS-CoV-2 positive plasma control ( @card@ ) . use the assay protocol describe below , the high signal-to-noise ratio at different RBD Mab S562-109 concentration and different dilution of NIBSC’s positive control in PBT buffer ( PBS with 1 % BSA and @card@ % Tween @card@ ) be the criterion for the final selection of the bead type for the serological assay development . as a second step of bead optimization upon the bead type finalization , different amount of RBD and spike antigen from 2 to @card@ µg of viral antigen be use in the coupling reaction to @card@ × @card@ microbeads . again , high signal-to-noise ratio of the assay perform use the same positive and negative control be the criterion for the final selection of the amount of viral antigen for the coupling reaction . Microbeads , e. g. , MagPlex-C bead , conjugate with either spike or RBD antigen be sonicated briefly and then combine follow by a buffer exchange from the storage buffer to an assay buffer use a magnetic separator . a microsphere stock suspension be make at a final concentration of @card@ beads/µL for each antigen coated bead in PBT buffer . on a 96-well plate , @card@ µL of the work stock suspension be aliquoted into each well and @card@ µL of diluted control , reference standard , or patient sample with various dilution be add to appropriate well of the plate . the plate be cover to protect it from light and incubate for @card@ min at room temperature on a plate shaker at ≈800 rpm . the plate be then place onto the magnetic separator and separation be allow to occur for 1 min . the supernatant be remove carefully by manual inversion . then , @card@ µL of wash buffer be add to each well , mix well , and then place onto the magnetic separator to remove supernatant . the washing step be repeat once more for a total of two wash . a @card@ µL of PE-labeled detection antibody , either 4 µg/mL of anti-IgG for IgG assay or @card@ µg/mL of anti-IgM for IgM assay , be add per well . the plate be cover to protect from light and incubate for @card@ min at room temperature on the plate shaker at ≈800 rpm . after two wash with wash buffer , the microsphere be again suspend in a @card@ µL of wash buffer . the microsphere be pipette up and down several time with a multichannel pipettor . sample be then analyze with 3000–5000 gat bead event per antigen coated microsphere on a CytoFLEX LX flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Palatine , Il , USA ) . in our assay , the convalescent patient sample be add to a sample well contain both RBD coated bead and spike coated bead with different fluorescence emission dye ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . this permit us to run duplex assay . the antibody bind to both bead be detect by either pe label anti-human IgG or anti-human IgM . each sample have two group of PE fluorescence signal , one group associate with the RBD bead , and the other group with spike bead . the two group of fluorescence signal provide a measure of the median fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) for the RBD and spike bead . a monoclonal IgG against SARS-CoV , Mab S562-109 ( RBD specific ) , be use as a reference IgG control for quantify IgG titer in patient sample because of its cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( private communication with Dr. Corbett at NIAID , NIH ) . a calibration curve be construct use different amount of Mab S562-109 spike in @card@ dilution of negative serum SRM 909c . the calibration curve of IgGRBD vs. MFI be generate use mAb S562-109 on microbeads couple with RBD , and subsequently fit to a logistic curve give by Equation ( 1 ) [ @card@ ] . ( 1)MFI=a×Concb+Conc where a give the limit MFI at large antibody concentration and b be the concentration at which MFI be equal to a/2 . the two parameter and their uncertainty be obtain from the covariance matrix calculate by a curve fitting program implement in Python . equation ( 1 ) can be invert to give expect IgG concentration value for a give MFI . it be assume that the equilibrium number of IgG on bead suspend in the patient sample be the same as the equilibrium number of IgG on bead suspend in a reference IgG solution . in that case , the inverted form of Equation ( 1 ) can be use to estimate the concentration of IgG in the sample give the MFI of bead incubate in the sample . the uncertainty of the concentration estimate can be obtain use uncertainty propagation in Equation ( 2 ) ( the inverted form of Equation ( 1 ) , ( 2)Conc=b×MFIa−MFI RBD coated bead ( 1 × @card@ µL per well ) be incubate with @card@ µL/well of\n",

( 4)Reduction %=max+min−max1+NT50dilutionn here , Max and min be parameter represent maximum and minimum response , respectively . NT50 be the neutralization antibody titer at which the response be @card@ % of the maximum ( @card@ % of the RBD site be occupy by Nab ) , and n determine how fast the transition from max to min occur .   Healthcare staff perception towards influenza and potential COVID-19 vaccination in the @card@ pandemic context Healthcare worker ( HCWs ) have a high risk of exposure to occupationally associate infectious disease [ 1 ] . vaccination of HCWs be encourage to reduce the risk of infection of hepatitis B , tuberculosis , and seasonal influenza [ [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ] . vaccination for seasonal influenza be see as particularly important not only to protect staff and patient , but also to ensure that seasonal workforce sickness rate do not compromise care . despite the importance of these programme there remain reluctance from some HCWs to receive vaccination for numerous reason , thus trigger research on how good to increase immunization rate in National Health Service ( NHS ) staff in the UK [ @card@ ] . in some setting mandatory influenza vaccination have be propose or implement [ 8 ] . in the Northern Hemisphere there be significant concern that seasonal influenza could co-circulate during surge of SARS-CoV-2 activity during the COVID-19 pandemic , place significant burden on healthcare service [ 9 ] . there be also a risk that co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza or other respiratory virus might increase morbidity and mortality [ @card@ ] . therefore a survey be conduct to understand the perception of HCWs towards receive routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the @card@ season , and to understand the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against the new COVID-19 context . the aim be also to understand staff perception towards receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 ahead of the introduction of these vaccine . this research will be relevant to future winter , as it be likely that influenza and COVID-19 will coexist . an electronic survey of staff member be conduct at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust ( UHCW ) , a 1250-bed major tertiary referral centre in the West Midlands region , employ just over @card@ full-time equivalent staff and provide a full spectrum of paediatric , obstetric , adult , neurosurgery , and trauma service . the centre go on to be the first globally to administer the first approve Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial . the survey be design to identify perception of healthcare worker towards receive routine seasonal influenza vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , as well as understand staff perception towards receive a COVID-19 vaccination in the future . the survey be live from September 2nd to 13th , @card@ . the survey be design by a multi-disciplinary collaboration of clinician and research and development staff , include a consultant virologist , consultant microbiologist and an infection prevention and control nurse . it be base on the previously publish survey at this organization on staff perception towards antibody testing , and it utilize a number of the same construct [ @card@ ] . the survey comprise a mixture of Likert-based response and binary response depend on question type , with @card@ question in all . the survey be develop use GoogleForms software and ethical approval be grant through the Trust’s COVID-19 ethic committee ( GAFREC Id : GF0416 ) . it be distribute electronically through a rolling advert on the intranet homepage alongside group e-mails to staff member . staff be advise that the survey be voluntary . the result be analyse use descriptive and semiquantitative method , with subdivision of result depend on staff role . in all , @card@ response be receive from the @card@ Trust HCWs , yield a response rate of @card@ % . response be receive from @card@ medical staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ nursing staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ administrative staff ( @card@ % ) , @card@ allied health professional ( @card@ % ) , @card@ manager ( @card@ % ) , and @card@ healthcare assistant ( @card@ % ) . the mean duration of NHS employment for respondent be @card@ year . in response to the question ‘ How often do you get the annual influenza vaccine ? ' , @card@ staff ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccination every year without fail , while @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccine most year , @card@ ( @card@ % ) report they get an influenza vaccine some year , @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they get an influenza vaccine occasionally and @card@ ( @card@ % ) report that they never get vaccinate . figure 1 report the relative importance that staff place on different motivation for get an annual influenza vaccine . table 1 record staff perception regard both influenza and potential COVID-19 vaccination , with the majority of staff identify the need to vaccinate in order to protect themselves , their family , and their patient as the drive reason to get vaccinate . a total of @card@ staff ( @card@ % ) report that if a fully approve COVID-19 vaccine become available , freely distribute through their employer , with appropriate safety and efficacy datum , they would be likely or very likely to get a vaccine . this be an electronically distribute survey with a relatively large number of response ( albeit low response rate ) despite the confine and challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic . the overall response to question regard influenza vaccination be encourage , with @card@ % of respondent identify the need to protect themselves , their family , and their patient , and suggest that they be likely to present themselves for vaccination . these response be consistent with the report that @card@ % of respondent get the influenza vaccine every year , and a further @card@ % most or some year . these @card@ % represent an important group to target and to understand motivation because they be clearly not anti-vaccination but be likely to get vaccinate when access be easy rather than to actively seek out vaccination . there be an important minority ( @card@ % ) who feel that influenza vaccination be less important for the @card@ season because they perceive that social distancing provide adequate protection . although influenza rate during the winter of @card@ have be very low , this may point to grow complacency in future year , despite the ongoing likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus will coexist [ @card@ ] . fortunately , a great number of HCWs ( @card@ % ) report that they be more likely to get an influenza vaccine this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic . the motivation for respondent to receive an influenza vaccination show important finding , despite substantial problem with staff healthcare service over the COVID-19 pandemic . reduce workplace absence be see as the least important reason to get an influenza vaccine . regard incentivization , opinion be divide , with @card@ % in favour of , and @card@ % against ; this be an area that need careful ethical consideration . a substantial proportion ( @card@ % ) feel that people not get an influenza vaccine should not receive sick pay if they be absent from work with influenza-like symptom . unfortunately , no datum be available from the pre-COVID-19 period to determine whether experience of staff absence due to COVID-19 have influence opinion . remarkably , around one-quarter feel that HCWs refuse COVID-19 vaccine who then have to self-isolate follow contact either at or outside work should not be pay . possibly this indicate a great personal responsibility during the pandemic , or a perception that influenza be less serious . despite the disruption cause by the COVID-19 pandemic , not all respondent report that they be likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine . however , easy access to vaccination be important , with only @card@ % be prepare to get a COVID-19 vaccine outside of their normal working hour , and @card@ % prepare to travel to another site . it will be important to retrospectively consider COVID-19 vaccine uptake rate once rollout have be complete , and to understand what feature drive the increase uptake across differ vaccination strategy throughout the NHS . there be relatively broad consensus that NHS staff should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination and even more so those in frontline patient-facing role . whereas it could be argue that it be not surprising that HCWs would see themselves as priority for vaccination , it be notable that a large proportion of non-frontline , non-patient-facing staff indicate that their frontline colleague should be prioritized . however , the vaccine rollout in the UK actually place social care staff and patient ahead of NHS staff [ @card@ ] . this study have a number of strength , include a relatively large sample size across the full range of HCW job type . we believe that our work provide a unique insight into HCW perception regard influenza and COVID-19 vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . there be , however , a number of limitation , include the single-centre nature of the study , and the fact that the study be perform before much information about the imminent COVID-19 vaccine be available . the survey be distribute to all staff member at the organization via e-mail and the intranet webpage , ensure that all staff have the opportunity to complete the survey ; however , we can be certain that the result be truly representative of HCW attitude , due to the rather low response rate . perhaps the main importance of this research be to lay foundation for important future study review the actual uptake of vaccination . it will be important to determine the reason give by HCWs for take up or decline influenza and/or COVID-19 vaccination . it will also be important to monitor ongoing perception of COVID-19 vaccination . particular focus be need around vaccine reticence among healthcare worker and ensure uptake across all demographic group . none . [ 5 ] . none declare .   restructure ENT out-patient service during the coronavirus disease @card@ pandemic – an iterative approach late January @card@ see the first case of coronavirus disease @card@ ( Covid-19 ) in the UK,1 with the global outbreak be identify as a pandemic by early March @card@ the swift , exponential rise in case and report death throughout March @card@ ultimately require the UK government to adopt a nationwide disease suppression strategy.3 sequential non-pharmaceutical intervention be rapidly introduce , to lower the reproduction number and significantly reduce viral transmission:4 self-isolation be follow by social distancing and school closure , public event be ban , and a country-wide lockdown be declared.5 despite these measure , the UK have report @card@ @card@ confirm case and @card@ @card@ death as of 10th June @card@ Covid-19 infection be cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2).7 it be highly contagious , spread more readily than influenza.8 the virus spread predominantly via small droplet originate from the upper respiratory tract during talk , cough or sneezing.8,9 Aerosol-generating procedure be think to pose a particular threat for healthcare workers.10 in part , infection severity be think to be directly relate to viral load exposure , with high viral load more likely to cause infection and more severe illness , as see in influenza.11 the virus remain viable on plastic and stainless steel for up to @card@ hours.12 Contaminated surface thus represent an additional , albeit subordinate , potential route of spread,8 but their consideration in healthcare setting be critical . on 17th March , National Health Service ( NHS ) trust be instruct to postpone all non-urgent elective activity in order to maximise capacity to deal with the anticipated wave of Covid-19 case , and to prevent the unnecessary exposure of non-infected individual during routine elective activity.13 consequently , advice be issue to convert non-urgent out-patient consultation into remotely conduct appointment where possible or , if not feasible , to postpone such activity.14 Face-to-face attendance be reserve for clinically urgent or emergency case only . management guideline be publish to minimise the exposure of healthcare worker and patient to Covid-19 ; @card@ these address personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and clarify new good practice . early report follow the Covid-19 outbreak in China highlight ENT surgery and ophthalmology as amongst the high risk specialty for medical staff to contract the infection.16 established respiratory virus pandemic relate guidance on infection control measure require to perform aerosol-generating procedure suggest that these procedure be conduct by the most experienced person , with minimum staff require , in a single room , whilst wear full PPE.17 however , the evidence base for this remain controversial.10 in Ent , particular attention have focus on identify which procedure should be class as aerosol-generating procedures,18 thus require level 3 PPE.9 these include : flexible nasendoscopy , oral examination , aural microsuction , nasal packing and nasal cautery . on 29th April @card@ , guidance be issue on how to re-establish elective service during the Covid-19 pandemic,19,20 whilst social distancing and stringent infection control requirement persist , and later updated.21 How to flexibly adapt service to ongoing change in guidance whilst ensure safe practice remain a continue challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic . here we report an iterative , four-cycle change in practice project , by which we restructure our ENT out-patient service to accommodate pandemic-related guidance in a data-driven manner . we conduct a prospective quality improvement project examine the ENT out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham . it encompass a literature review , four data collection cycle and two survey . a literature search of the PubMed and Cochrane database be conduct ( search 1 – ‘ COVID-19 ' , ‘ outpatient ' and ‘ Ent ' ; search 2 – ‘ COVID-19 ' and ‘ outpatient ' ; and search 3 – ‘ COVID-19 ' , ‘ outpatient ' and ‘ aerosol generating procedure ' ) . in addition , publish guideline from Public Health England , the Royal College of Surgeons of England and Ent UK be scrutinise for their relevance to out-patient clinic set-up need to incorporate aerosol-generating procedure during the Covid-19 pandemic . the paper identify via the literature search be screen for relevance by title . publication be exclude if they be unrelated to the organisation of out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic , or if they only contain non-specific infection control out-patient recommendation . the remain article be read in full to determine if they relate specifically to the organisation of out-patient service during the Covid-19 pandemic and encompass datum on the timing of aerosol-generating procedure , or specifically address the challenge of maintain patient flow in a department with a high volume of aerosol-generating procedure . the four quality improvement project cycle each last one week ( Figure 1 ) . initial analysis of the default Ent out-patient clinic set-up prompt consultation by the contribute author with senior out-patient nursing , medical and infection control staff , which initiate a change in practice to accommodate infection control relate issue surround aerosol-generating procedure ( recommendation in cycle 1 , Table 1 ) . datum be collect prospectively from 21st to 27th April @card@ ( cycle 1 ) to assess the adequacy of this new clinic set-up , and again from 1st to 7th May @card@ ( cycle 2 ) , 8th to 14th May @card@ ( cycle 3 ) , and 15th to 21st May @card@ ( cycle 4 ) . electronic patient record be use to clarify miss datum where require . datum collect include the number of in-person out-patient attendance , and the number of aerosol-generating procedure perform . from cycle 2 onwards , datum be collect on : the type of procedure perform ( all type with a frequency of three or less be group as ‘ miscellaneous ' ) , aerosol-generating procedure duration , and whether the procedure be perform in the emergency review clinic ( staff by junior doctor ) or a consultant-led clinic . room disinfection measure follow the performance of an aerosol-generating procedure be conduct accord to local hospital policy ; specifically , a rest period ( @card@ minute ) , which allow airborne particle to settle ( determine by the number of ventilate air change per hour per room ) , be follow by room disinfection ( @card@ minute ) . Two e-mail survey ( survey 1 and 2 ; Table 2 ) be send to senior out-patient nursing staff and all member of the ENT medical staff , to obtain feedback on the restructure clinic set-up ( 36-hour response window ) . the datum collection and survey result be disseminate to the survey staff via a socially distant governance meeting and e-mail ( outcome dissemination 1 and 2 ) , and later via a newly set up work group ( outcome dissemination 3 and 4 ) . new recommendation for further clinic restructuring ( recommendation in cycle 2–5 ) be develop and implement at the time of outcome dissemination , prior to further datum collection . Spearman 's rank correlation be use to evaluate correlation between in-person attendance and the number of procedure perform . pair t-tests be use to evaluate difference between mean timing accord to the type of procedure perform and the type of clinic that the procedure be perform in . statistical analysis be carry out use MatLab2019a . the literature search identify @card@ article , of which @card@ be exclude after screening by title . Seventeen article be identify as potentially relevant and scrutinise in full . of these , @card@ be exclude as they do not cover out-patient clinic set-up encompass aerosol-generating procedure during the Covid-19 pandemic . the remain two publication describe ENT clinic model incorporate aerosol-generating procedures.22,23 however , neither publication consider out-patient model base on datum that include aerosol-generating procedure duration , nor specifically address the challenge of maintain patient flow in a department carry out a high volume of aerosol-generating procedure . the iteration cycle perform during our study period include : four data collection episode , two survey , four point of outcome dissemination and five set of recommendation ( Figure 1 ) . throughout the study , in-person attendance increase four-fold between cycle 1 and cycle 4 , whilst the amount of aerosol-generating procedure perform rise by @card@ per cent ( Table 3 ) . out-patient attendance be greatest on Thursday in cycle 1 ( @card@ per cent of attendance ) , Wednesday in cycle 2 ( @card@ per cent ) , Wednesday in cycle 3 ( @card@ per cent ) and Thursday in cycle 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . Aerosol-generating procedure be most frequently perform on Thursday in cycle 1 ( @card@ per cent ) , Friday in cycle 2 ( @card@ per cent ) , Monday in cycle 3 ( @card@ per cent ) and Thursday in cycle 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . overall , there be a statistically significant correlation between in-person attendance and the number of procedure perform ( p < @card@ ) . Survey 1 have a @card@ per cent response rate ( @card@ out of @card@ , comprise 7 consultant , 4 middle-grade doctor , 6 senior house officer or foundation year doctor , and 1 senior nurse ) . of the respondent , @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have see patient in person during cycle 1 , and @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have access to PPE as recommend . One respondent could not access the power air-purifying respirator , require a colleague ( successfully fit-tested for a filter facepiece code 3 ( FFP3 ) mask ) to perform that aerosol-generating procedure . Seven of the @card@ respondent have problem find a room to perform an aerosol-generating procedure , all of whom identify day 3 ( Thursday ) in cycle 1 as the problem day . response to question 7 in survey 1 identify a lack of room availability for aerosol-generating procedure , with concern that this may become a great problem once elective activity resume ( eight respondent ) . answer to question 8 in survey 1 suggest that more aerosol-generating procedure room be need ( four respondent ) , with separate Covid-19 negative and positive area be maintain ( three respondent ) . complete response can be view in Appendix 1 . finding from the first data collection episode and the first survey be disseminate and discuss at our clinical governance meeting ( outcome dissemination 1 ) , from whence recommendation for further clinic restructuring ( recommendation in cycle 2 ) be compile ( Table 1 ) . of note , the first data collection episode and the first survey identify that cycle 1 , day 3 ( Thursday ) have be the most problematic , with the most attendance , the most aerosol-generating procedure and a report acute shortage of available room to perform aerosol-generating procedure . analysis of the attendance time identify that all patient require aerosol-generating procedure ( n = 5 ) have attend in the same 90-minute window , on a day when several parallel head and neck cancer clinic take place . follow consultation with departmental staff , five room be make available for aerosol-generating procedure ( instead of two ) , and ring-fenced as ‘ procedure room ' . the hot and cold room set-up for aerosol-generating procedure be abandon , as local infection control advice identify that all room use for aerosol-generating procedure require identical cleaning procedure irrespective of a patient 's Covid-19 status . the don room be also drop , as PPE can be don in the procedure room prior to perform an aerosol-generating procedure . it be identify that aerosol-generating procedure datum be need to enable appropriate forward planning . this be include in the recommendation for cycle 2 . subsequent recommendation be detail in Table 1 , include outcome status at the time of publication . overall , @card@ change in practice recommendation be make during cycle 1–4 , of which @card@ per cent ( @card@ of @card@ ) have be achieve , @card@ per cent ( 5 of @card@ ) have be partly achieve and @card@ per cent ( 8 of @card@ ) remain to be achieve at the time of writing . datum on aerosol-generating procedure duration be collect for @card@ per cent , @card@ per cent and @card@ per cent of aerosol-generating procedure in cycle 2 , cycle 3 and cycle 4 , respectively ( Table 4 ) . the reduction in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration between cycle 2 and cycle 4 be statistically significant ( p = @card@ ) ; however , no significant difference exist between cycle 2 and 3 ( p = @card@ ) , or between cycle 3 and 4 ( p = @card@ ) . the range of aerosol-generating procedure duration remain similar for the different cycle . table 5 show the overall number of aerosol-generating procedure accord to clinic type , for which timing have be record during cycle 2 , 3 and 4 . overall , datum on aerosol-generating procedure duration be collect for @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ per cent ) and @card@ of @card@ ( @card@ per cent ) of aerosol-generating procedure perform in the emergency clinic and consultant-led clinic , respectively . there be no statistically significant difference between the mean aerosol-generating procedure duration in the emergency clinic versus consultant-led clinic ( p = @card@ ) . table 6 depict the type of aerosol-generating procedure perform accord to procedure type , with no statistically significant difference in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration . Survey 2 have a @card@ per cent response rate ( @card@ out of @card@ , comprise 3 consultant , 7 middle-grade doctor , 5 senior house officer or foundation year doctor , and 1 senior nurse ) . of these , @card@ have see patient during the datum collection period . One of @card@ respondent have difficulty find a room in which to perform an aerosol-generating procedure . Free-text answer be outline in Appendix 2 . follow cycle 2 , we identify that @card@ per cent of junior doctor ( 9 of @card@ ) have fail fit-testing for FFP3 mask , thereby require a power air-purifying respirator in order to have adequate PPE . thus , subsequent recommendation include that power air-purifying respirator should be readily available in the ENT out-patient department ( Table 1 ) . during our study period , the number of ENT ring-fenced seat in the out-patient wait room be reduce from @card@ ( pre-pandemic ) to 4 ( @card@ per cent ) . at the end of cycle 4 , this be raise as a potential rate-limiting step , as footfall have start to increase , influence subsequent clinic template proposal . manage an out-patient department during the current Covid-19 pandemic pose new challenge , particularly in high-risk specialty such as otolaryngology,24 where aerosol-generating procedure be perform frequently . Covid-19 related guidance stress PPE requirement for aerosol-generating procedures,18,24,25 include how PPE should be don and doffed.26,27 however , most NHS Ent out-patient department be not set-up to easily accommodate infection control measure relate to respiratory pandemic . early recognition that safe performance of aerosol-generating procedure would pose a particular challenge for our out-patient service during this pandemic initiate the iterative change in practice approach report here . this enable rapid , data-driven restructuring of our out-patient set-up , ensure the safe performance of otherwise routine Ent procedure . To date , minimal literature report on out-patient service in the Covid-19 pandemic exist . Lal et al.28 produce recommendation for an orthopaedic out-patient department . they adjust their clinic set-up with respect to social distancing requirement , and publish a floor-plan and patient flow model . they estimate the likely maximum clinic capacity from clinician ' estimation of procedure duration,29 but do not report collect datum to support and refine these change . additionally , the orthopaedic clinic do not routinely perform large number of aerosol-generating procedure and , thus , plan for these do not form part of their work . our literature review identify that , to date , little specific evidence exist regard : the performance of aerosol-generating procedure , out-patient footfall , and the incorporation of infection control measure relate to Covid-19 within an ENT out-patient setting . of the two article identify as relevant , Weiss et al.23 describe change to the set-up of their out-patient Ent department , include the double triage of patient into ‘ hot ' and ‘ cold ' stream , to minimise room contamination . they integrate this into an ‘ operational concept ' and implement it within @card@ hour follow approval from infection control team . they allude to their ‘ operational concept ' have be produce by an iterative process , but do not publish the structure of this process , or evidence of cyclical datum collection , recommendation and feedback . in contrast , Lescanne et al.22 produce a stepwise guide to the re-organisation of ENT out-patient service , which include change to their triage area , wait area and reception area , to minimise contact between patient and staff . they identify that common ENT procedure would produce infectious aerosol , require stringent PPE and disinfection , but do not examine the unique space and time constraint pose by high volume of aerosol-generating procedure in an out-patient department . neither of these publish study report an iterative approach to out-patient clinic structure that be drive by recorded attendance and timing datum . overall , the iterative approach we use enable the formulation of @card@ recommendation during the study period . the majority of these have be achieve by the time of writing ( @card@ per cent ) , most within the cycle subsequent to the identification of the issue . our result demonstrate a four-fold increase in face-to-face attendance during the period study . this may reflect patient ' initial relative fear of attend hospital towards the beginning of lockdown , which have be subside as report of new Covid-19 infection and death abate . as expect , we find a statistically significant correlation between the number of in-person attendance and aerosol-generating procedure perform . whilst recent month have see an increase use of telemedicine and virtual clinic to accommodate elective out-patient activity , this may decrease as elective face-to-face service be resumed.19–21 particularly in Ent , where remote patient examination be challenging , out-patient department need to expect an ever-increase footfall and prepare to accommodate the grow number of associate aerosol-generating procedure . interestingly , our study highlight that different factor can limit the number of clinic attendance an Ent department will be able to accommodate . One rate-limiting step identify be the significantly reduce number of seat in our wait area because of distancing requirement ( 4 instead of @card@ seat ) . another be the finite number of procedure room available for perform aerosol-generating procedure ( n = 5 ) . our result also identify a mean aerosol-generating procedure duration of @card@ minute overall , which drop from a mean of @card@ minute ( in cycle 2 ) to a mean of @card@ minute ( in cycle 4 ) . this statistically significant reduction be highly unlikely to be relate to a sudden increase in clinician ' speed at perform the procedure . instead , we suggest it indicate a learn curve effect regarding don and doff PPE , as well as a more efficient use of procedure room for aerosol-generating procedure . contrastingly , no significant difference in mean aerosol-generating procedure duration be identify between nasoendoscopy , nasal packing and aural microsuction , indicate that the turn-around time for procedure room be similar irrespective of the nature of the aerosol-generating procedure perform . additionally , we find no statistically significant difference in aerosol-generating procedure duration in the emergency clinic versus consultant-led clinic . overall , our datum have enable a single timing figure to be use to plan all of the propose clinic template . follow aerosol-generating procedure , a procedure room must ‘ rest ' before it be safe to clean.9 this rest period be dependent on the number of air circulations.9 in our department , a procedure room require a 20-minute rest period , follow by a 20-minute disinfection period . consequently , our procedure room be ‘ occupied ' for a mean of @card@ minute ( equate to the mean aerosol-generating procedure length plus the rest period plus the disinfection period ) for every aerosol-generating procedure perform . this total ‘ room time ' directly determine the number of aerosol-generating procedure that can be perform in one procedure room per session , which will be significantly reduce compare to pre-pandemic session . additional factor may impose further restriction to patient throughput and will need to be assess individually for each department . Aerosol-generating procedure represent a unique challenge to ENT out-patient service during the coronavirus disease @card@ ( Covid-19 ) pandemicThis be the first report describe data-driven change to ENT out-patient service during a respiratory pandemicAnalysis of rate-limiting step enable development of a safe , workable , Covid-19 out-patient modelA multidisciplinary approach be paramount to ensure successful , rapid introduction of service changesIterative approach to practice change allow pandemic-related issue to be address swiftly and flexibly most clinician be familiar with the clinical audit cycle . a clinical audit 's critical feature be a comparison to publish well practice.29 whilst there be useful publish guiding principle for social distancing and clean in an out-patient setting,9,18,22,28,30 there be no replicable ‘ gold-standard ' model relate to aerosol-generating procedure within the out-patient setting during the Covid-19 pandemic . thus , our work do not fit the traditional definition of a clinical audit cycle . instead , early recognition that our clinic set-up would need to accommodate aerosol-generating procedure lead to initial clinic restructuring recommendation , which catalyse an ongoing , flexible and radical change in practice , underpin by an iterative approach . the Association of Qualitative Research describe the iterative approach as ‘ particularly useful for time-sensitive project where there be not scope for multiple round of research’.31 we posit that restructure our set-up early , and respond to issue as they arise , would enable us to remain abreast of ongoing change to practice guideline . our approach share some key concept find in the ‘ agile ' methodology common in current management doctrine,32 which stress a short-cycle process of implement change , follow by testing and rapid feedback to correct issue . Tolf et al.33 examine the application of agile concept to hospital management , report that agile approach be underpin by a capacity to flexibly respond to both organisational and environmental variability . the high degree of unpredictability frequently see in hospital setting allow the agile approach to be of great value for change hospital management process . we suggest that in volatile circumstance , such as the current pandemic , an agile approach also provide a highly constructive strategy with which to address clinical process in the face of rapid change . the Covid-19 pandemic have bring unprecedented change to healthcare system globally . in otolaryngology , aerosol-generating procedure comprise a common , necessary part of out-patient activity , pose a particular challenge during this pandemic . as elective out-patient work resume , every ENT department need to consider how to accommodate increase number of aerosol-generating procedure with minimum risk of infection for patient and staff . currently , no literature exist to directly address this challenge . our four-loop quality improvement project incorporate principle find in iterative approach common to agile model use in business . this allow real-time , creative adaptation of ENT out-patient service to introduce pandemic-related change . it enable early recognition that aerosol-generating procedure now take far longer to complete , which impact out-patient activity . it also allow us to accommodate a four-fold increase in footfall and related aerosol-generating procedure in our service . we recommend this methodology for situation where unexpected , rapid out-patient service adjustment be require . we suggest data collection start simply , follow the first out-patient restructuring activity . it should cover aspect such as out-patient footfall trend , room and wait area availability , and timing of possible rate-limiting step . the cyclically gather datum should then be assess in a multidisciplinary setting consist of relevant stake-holder . this facilitate a unified approach for subsequent practice adjustment . the whole process should continue until an optimum steady state of practice have be reach . our finding demonstrate a constructive , rapid and successful process with which to tackle pandemic-related service challenge , without breach the guiding principle that protect patient and staff .   a Health Rights Impact Assessment Guide for Artificial Intelligence Projects Artificial intelligence ( Ai ) be be hail by various actor , include United Nations agency , as have the potential to alleviate poverty , reduce inequality , and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs).1 many Ai project be promote as make important contribution to health care and to reduce global and national health inequity . however , one of the risk of AI-driven health project be that they can be singularly focus on one health problem and implement to resolve that one problem , without consideration of how a whole health system be need to enable any one “ solution ” to function in both the short and long term . health project that have not be design in participation with local people have a history of fail , and externally fund development project be especially vulnerable . in term of human right , such failing can be attribute to a lack of participation , an imbalance of power , and failure to observe the critically important role of key institution such as the health system in fulfill people’s health right . health project that fail can have negative consequence beyond their own failed mission , and they risk harm human right generally and the right to health specifically . equitable access to quality health care be dependent on a well-function health system ; and such a system be regard as the core institution through which the right to health can be fulfilled.2 if a new project weaken the health system , perhaps by attract a disproportionate number of health worker to it , or overload diagnostic or supply chain service , or draw finance away from other core service , then it be negatively affect state obligation to fulfill the right to health . these risk may be great where health system be weakest—usually in low- and middle-income country . this perspective argue that the way to mitigate these risk be to conduct a health right impact assessment prior to their implementation . it introduce a tool that enable a systematic process of health right assessment to take place . in @card@ , the World Health Organization ( who ) introduce a guideline on how to use digital technology to strengthen health systems.3 the guideline provide useful indicator for assess some of the impact of Ai on health system , but it fail to locate the centrality of health system to the fulfilment of the right to health . the guideline follow a resolution bring to the World Health Assembly in @card@ that recognize the value of digital technology ( include Ai ) and their capacity to advance universal health coverage and the SDGs.4 however , the guideline concede that enthusiasm for digital health have see many short-lived implementation , an overwhelming diversity of digital tool , and a limited understanding of their impact on health system and people’s well-being.5 it stress the need to evaluate the positive and negative impact of propose digital health technology and to ensure that such investment do not inappropriately divert resource from alternative , nondigital approach and thereby increase health inequities.6 the guideline advise that digital health technology should complement and enhance health system function , rather than replace the fundamental component need by health system , such as the health workforce , financing , leadership and governance , and access to essential medicines.7 it call for an assessment of the health system’s ability to absorb digital intervention and warn that new technology must not jeopardize the provision of quality nondigital service in place where digital technology can be deploy . it demonstrate the assessment of various application of health-related technology base on effectiveness , acceptability , feasibility , resource use , and “ gender , equity and human right . ” the guideline encourage technology developer to work with user and to think broadly about context both within and beyond the health system , as well as to consider whether a give digital health intervention will improve universal health coverage . although human right be include with the “ gender , equity and human right ” component for impact analysis , the specific indicator select to assess this component be limit to the technology’s impact on equity.8 but equity—important as it may be—is only one human right consideration . it be also necessary to examine other key principle of the right to health when assess health interventions.9 although the who guideline examine various component of a health system when the component be directly affect by the technology , it fail to systematically examine the whole health system to identify any less obvious , indirect impact of the propose new technology . in response , this paper present an expanded tool to help state and other actor undertake a right to health impact assessment prior to implement Ai project . the tool , inform by the who guideline , be a refinement of an early impact assessment tool of aid-funded health project in low-resource settings.10 it accommodate additional consideration necessary when Ai health project be under development . it explore possible impact , specifically on the right to health , move beyond the civil and political right most frequently associate with digital health , big datum , and AI—namely , data privacy and protection , security , and algorithm transparency . it be a guide that provide a sample of the type of question across the health system that need to be explored—but each project will need its own context-specific adjustment . because the health system be the core institution through which the right to health can be realize , government and other agency have a duty to ensure that health system be enable to fulfill people’s entitlement to available , accessible , acceptable , and quality health service ( AAAQ).11 accordingly , government have a human right obligation to ensure that health system be never weaken but rather continually improve as part of their progressive realization duty , as detailed in General Comment @card@ of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights.12 One way to prevent a weakening of the health system while demonstrate a commitment to the progressive realization of the right to health be to carry out human right impact assessment prior to adopt and implement policy and programs.13 this apply to project relate to digital health , project drive by Ai ( irrespective of whether they be government or nonstate initiative ) , and project drive by local funding or through international assistance and cooperation . in order to conduct a health right impact assessment on a health system , it be convenient to compartmentalize the system to enable impact to be measure across its many function . a useful schematic devise by who identify the component part that contribute to the delivery of health care : health service and facility ; health worker ; health financing ; medicine , product , and other supply ; health information system ; and management and governance.14 importantly , there be more to a health system than these technocratic element : people and community must also be include , as the right to health entitle them to participate in a meaningful way in the planning , delivery , and monitor of health care and health promotion . human rights-based approach to health care and health project promote the active engagement of people who will be use service , as well as the understanding that people be legally entitle to these service as a function of their right to health . without people’s participation , health service can achieve AAAQ for all . a health right impact assessment be a systematic examination of a project , undertake prior to its implementation , to anticipate the effect that it will have on human right and health , include and extend beyond its own project-related goal . it should not be confuse with , nor replace by , a need assessment , which be a narrow exercise that do not assess risk . a health right impact assessment predict immediate and longer-term impact on the whole health system by examine each of the system’s component part and assess the way in which the project could strengthen or weaken that component . if risk be identify , an impact assessment consider way to mitigate them . the purpose of such an assessment be at least twofold : it aim to strengthen the project by ensure that it be in alignment with the health system and its govern strategy and plan ; and it aim to strengthen the health system by help design project that will be sustainable and contribute to the protection and fulfilment of health rights.15 conduct a health right impact assessment when a project be be design can help government adopt and implement policy , program , and project that will well meet their obligation to take deliberate and concrete step toward the progressive realization of human rights.16 it serve a further purpose as well , by promote engagement with the key feature of the right to health , outline in Table @card@ even before the extraordinary pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic , health system worldwide be face challenge , include great demand for service with the rise burden of disease , increase cost , and poor productivity and overstretched human resource . it would therefore be of great benefit to health system and community if technological advance could help reduce burden on system and health care cost while increase accessibility and equity.18 in an opening address to the “ Ai for Good Summit ” in @card@ , the secretary-general of the International Telecommunications Union , Houlin Zhao , urge the audience to “ turn [ the ] data revolution into a development revolution . ” @card@ To achieve this revolution , though , it be imperative that the development context be fully understand and reflect in the datum solution . Development have a long history of failed project , especially those dependent on technology.20 enthusiastic donor can be persuasive partner when seek to test new technology in low-resource setting , and government in these setting be presently indicate that they be “ open for business ” when it come to Ai partnerships.21 not only be the well-known pitfall arise from a lack of ongoing technical or health worker support , or funding for maintenance , present with AI-based technology partnership , but additional traps as yet unknown can arise from downstream datum ownership , share , and reuse.22 Ai be be use in health care in various way , include in diagnosis ( especially image ) , patient management , treatment ( for example , robotic in surgery ) , and new drug development.23 in the wake of COVID-19 , technology be also play a large part in contact tracing , where it monitor the spread of the epidemic , and in the race to develop a vaccine.24 but many of these use demand a level of technical capacity well beyond that available to health system in low-resource setting . even if the technology be design elsewhere and import , its ongoing use require an adequate , well-trained , and available workforce ; infrastructure ( include , at the very least , electricity and Internet ) ; and accessible health facility so that the benefit of such advance be equitably available to all people . design data-driven technological project for health care in low-resource setting require a detailed understanding of their challenging context ; otherwise , the intervention will almost certainly be inappropriate or unsustainable . it be difficult to acquire such an understanding from afar . but even locally develop AI-based technological solution can fail to respect and protect human right if they be not support the local health system in meet the health right of the people in its jurisdiction.25 thus , regardless of whether Ai health project be be introduce in a development context ( a focus of Ai for Good ) or in high-income country , it be imperative that systematic health right impact assessment be undertake and that they be broad enough to anticipate impact on the health system component , as well as on civil and political right relate to datum privacy , ownership , and security . present in Table 2 , this assessment tool be frame to guide the development of Ai for health project that comply with a right to health framework in local context . each of the propose question be link to at least one of the key feature of the right to health . therefore , indicator be select to assess impact on the health system and on the right to health . this perspective have present a rationale for undertake a right to health impact assessment before implement Ai health project in high- or low-resource setting . such assessment be in keep with the United Nations ' draft business and human right instrument to regulate the activity of business and transnational corporations.26 the tool in Table 2 demonstrate the range of question that need to be address before implement Ai project to determine how a new technology might affect the health system and , therefore , the right to health . introduce an app that can , for example , diagnose skin cancer or detect a pregnant person’s increase risk of pre-term birth , do nothing to fulfill people’s right to health entitlement , or universal health coverage , if there be no suitable treatment available for skin cancer or secondary-level obstetric service accessible to those who need them . every component of the health system must be function well before a service can become equitably available , accessible , acceptable , and of good quality ; and if these and other right to health feature be not achieve , people’s right can be fulfill . this tool include question that not only probe the technocratic aspect of the health system—even though they be crucially important—but also assess other key right to health principle , include participation , accountability , equality and nondiscrimination , non-retrogression , and international cooperation . it be not enough for developer of a new Ai application to claim that their application will address one health service and will therefore “ help achieve SDG3 and universal health coverage ” ; without a right to health impact assessment , there can be no confidence that this be a likely outcome . similarly , all human right be interrelate and indivisible , which mean that a rights-based App assessment must look beyond the health sector to determine how the technology could also affect other right , include those relate to privacy , confidentiality , and security . the long-term sustainability of a technology-based business depend not only on state ' and business ' fulfillment of their obligation to protect human right but also on the development of product that service provider find useful , affordable , efficient , and acceptable to right holder , include man , woman , and child . these criterion apply whether the technology be state or nonstate own and develop . this work be support by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council ( grant number ES/M010236/1 ) .   impact of pandemic on mental health in lower- and middle-income country ( LMICs ) Globally , the COVID-19 pandemic have aggravate poverty and result in mental illness . this nexus of rise mental illness in low resource context and increase extreme poverty in lower- and middle-income country ( LMICs ) in the context of the global pandemic be now blatantly visible . these trend have not only exacerbate extreme poverty , but have also induce psychological distress and ill-health , thus significantly affect general mental health function of people across the globe . we ask for urgent action in develop policy that address poor mental health , which emanate from material deprivation and be currently intensify by the prevailing pandemic . our commentary highlight linkage between incidence of poverty and the rise of mental illness globally in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . mental ill-health and poverty be closely link in a complex negative cycle . it have be find that except for disease such as schizophrenia , where the genetic factor could be a dominant factor , extreme material deprivation result from the lack of gainful employment , inadequate nutrition , and lack of basic amenity could precede mental illness ( Patel et al . , @card@ ) . people affect by material deprivation be know to be at a high risk of mental illness ( World Health Organization , @card@ ) . extreme poverty , measure as earn less than USD @card@ a day by the World Bank , be accompany by hunger , overcrowd live condition , low accessibility and affordability of health service , limited educational and livelihood opportunity , and adverse life event associate with socioeconomic vulnerability . the culmination of these factor be know to increase risk of mental distress and mental illness ( Lund et al . , @card@ ) . over time an awareness in the field of mental health recognize that this vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill health need to be view from human right perspective . in addition , the focus on poverty alleviation within health science need a good alignment with the global development agenda ( Patel et al . , @card@ ; Kumar , @card@ ) . in general , people live in poverty also experience a low quality of life and exhibit low well-being indicator , such as poor health , social and physical security , and political freedom and choice . poverty increase the risk of mental illness that consequentially increase the likelihood of economic downturn at individual and family level ( World Health Organization , @card@ ) . individual with mental illness be stigmatize , actively discriminate against , and their ability to hold livelihood and access opportunity be reduce . the cost associate with mental health treatment also increase economic burden on the individual and the family ( Patel et al . , @card@ ) . this indicate that live with mental illness over time can also make one poor . before COVID-19 , one out of four people suffer from mental ill-health ( primarily anxiety and depression ) . now as approximately 3–4 billion people be place in lockdown as a mitigation response measure to COVID-19 , more and more people be suffer from anxiety . people be under acute stress stem from job loss , COVID-19-related death ( within family and friend ) , and abnormal situation associate with restriction of movement and social isolation . in addition , a large number of individual experience stress and anxiety from suspected exposure to COVID-19 and from be quarantine away from the secure confine of their home in LMICs . COVID-19 be merely one symptom of the dysfunctional relationship between human and nature , which be manifest through climate change , loss of biodiversity , habitat fragmentation , and domestication of wild animal ( UNEP , @card@ ) . in @card@ , the United Nations Environment Programme flag the worldwide increase in zoonotic epidemic . around @card@ % of all infectious disease in human be zoonotic , and the emergence of zoonotic disease be closely link with the deplete health of ecosystem ( UNEP , @card@ ) . there be emerge evidence from study in Wuhan , China , where the first lockdown be initiate as a measure to prepare for effective response to COVID-19 , that indicate that the lockdown in itself have severely impact the mental health of the Chinese people . Fu et al . ( @card@ ) report in a nationwide cross-sectional study that ease of the lockdown in the city be explicitly associate with stressful impact on a sizeable number of participant ( Ma et al . , @card@ ) . measure such as quarantine , isolation , and social distancing have seriously impact the mental health and general life of the people in China . expert have arrive at the consensus that these measure have trigger a wide variety of psychological disorder , such as panic disorder , anxiety , and depression in the general population ( Qiu et al . , @card@ ) . the result of a Chinese study review the effect of COVID-19 mitigation plan on mental health lead Wuhan 's government official to develop a multi-layered response that involve form psychological intervention team for key population that be likely to be impact by exposure to COVID-19 and its adverse risk factor ( Kang et al . , @card@ ) . these initial study from China have highlight the need to address vulnerable population , improve psychosocial and medical care access , ramp up disaster preparedness and mitigation , and strengthen health system , disaster management and intervention ( Qiu et al . , @card@ ) . public health emergency impact both individual and community . there be short- and long-term consequence for mental health and wellbeing , as witness in the post-epidemic phase of Ebola , SARS , and MERS ( Galea et al . , @card@ ) . during epidemic , in addition to a large number of the population suffering from depression and anxiety , surge in maladaptive high-risk behavior also increase , such as domestic violence and interpersonal conflict . issue surround fear , panic , and discrimination be be report ( Usher et al . , @card@ ) and be cover daily in news and social medium . opportunity to monitor psychosocial need and deliver intervention support during direct patient encounter in clinical practice be curtail in this crisis by large-scale home confinement ( Pfefferbaum and North , @card@ ) . it be estimate that the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in the general population range from 4 % to @card@ % and the prevalence of major depression will increase by 7 % after the outbreak ( Torales et al . , @card@ ) . the pandemic may worsen exist mental health problem and lead to more case among child and adolescent . this be due to the unique combination of the public health crisis , social isolation , disruption of education , limited peer interaction , boredom , and economic recession . all of these factor negatively impact wellbeing ( Golberstein et al . , @card@ ) . for those with exist and underlie health condition , these worry be further exacerbate due to the mass quarantine ( Rubin and Wessely , @card@ ) . give that globally @card@ million people have be infect , out of which approximately more than 1 million death have be record as of 7 October @card@ ( World Health Organization , 2020a ) , we know that the mental health need of individual who be infect and those who have recently recover may be significantly high . the\n",
            "isolation and loneliness around palliative care of those who succumb to the illness also mean that the family of these individual experience painful bereavement and traumatic grief . in many part of the world , relative and family member be stigmatize and force into quarantine . such measure be on the verge of become human right violation ( World Health Organization , 2020b ) and effort be need to uphold right and civil liberty . consequence of COVID-19 lockdown and mitigation effort have exacerbate the existing incidence of poverty and inequality among and within country . recently , the World Bank project that roughly @card@ million of the world 's population will be push into extreme poverty , assume that the COVID-19 pandemic do not change inequality within country or that the nation 's growth accumulate equally to everyone . Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia be anticipate to be the hard hit region , with @card@ million and @card@ million of the people in each region , respectively , project to be live on USD @card@ or less a day ( Gerzon et al . , @card@ ) . alongside monetary poverty , there be also acute multidimensional poverty , in which household be deprive of one-third or more of the @card@ indicator of health , education , and live standard set by the Sustainable Development Goals . the global multidimensional Poverty Index estimate that the 2 % ( or @card@ million ) of the world 's population , out of the @card@ million poor people , experience severe acute multidimensional poverty and another @card@ % ( or @card@ million people ) have not reach , but be vulnerable to acute multidimensional poverty ( UNDP , @card@ ) . the indicator of multidimensional poverty be when a household have a malnourished member , high child mortality , none in the family have complete 6 year of education , child do not attend school , clean drinking water be lack , nourish food be lack , improve sanitation be lack , and adequate safe housing be also lack . people experience acute multidimensional poverty be at extremely high-risk for COVID-19 and be often unable to comply with the preventative measure of social isolation ( UNDP , @card@ ) . this estimated projection of increase in monetary global poverty ( USD 5.5/day ) mean that any progress in eliminate extreme poverty would be set back by at least @card@ year ( World Bank , 2020a , b ) . the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of poverty be obvious and encompass . the world be experience a decline in gross domestic product between 4 % and 8 % in @card@ ( International Monetary Fund , @card@ ) . the restriction on movement of people , logistic bottleneck emanate from the lockdown , and in large case , the closure of production unit as a safety and health response have severely compromise the ability of the people to supply labor and earn wage . the impact be apparent in the extreme and marginal poor ( less than USD @card@ a day ) living in LMICs . for example , due to COVID-19 , sub-Saharan Africa would see a rise in people live under extreme poverty to @card@ million ( @card@ % ) by @card@ against the pre-COVID-19 estimate of @card@ % ( World Bank , 2020a , b ) . in general in LMICs , the hard-hit sector have a high proportion of informal worker and with limited access to health service and social protection . without appropriate policy measure , such worker risk fall into extreme poverty and will experience challenge in regain livelihood during the recovery period . in a recent COVID-19 mental health impact survey conduct by the who , result indicate the pandemic have disrupt or halt critical mental health service in @card@ % of country worldwide while the demand for mental health be increase ( World Health Organization , 2020c ) . we know that COVID-19 be strain the capacity of public health and essential service across the world . there be worry that the LMICs will be severely affect because investment in adequate staffing , health equipment , access to health service , and evidence-based guideline and their timely dissemination and coordinate implementation continue to be a challenge . Non-COVID-19 patient would suffer as much as those in need of serious medical intervention . recommended intervention for COVID-19 involve ( 1 ) the assessment of the accuracy of information , ( 2 ) enhance social support , ( 3 ) reduce the stigma associate with the disease , ( 4 ) maintain a normal life while adhere to safety measure , and ( 5 ) use psychosocial service , particularly online service , when need ( Rajkumar , @card@ ) . most of these response be compromise in under-resourced setting where health system can cope with preventive and promotive message and support . the treatment burden be in itself so significant that prevention and ancillary support service can be rally in a timely manner . those most affect in this pandemic be vulnerable low wage earn individual who also have underlie chronic condition . this be worsen if they also belong to vulnerable group , such as elderly , migrant worker , marginalize ethnic or racial group , woman , pregnant woman , and individual with mental illness . in such case , access to service and available support be also compromise ( Pfefferbaum and North , @card@ ; Rajkumar , @card@ ) . force quarantine and mark of informal settlement and locality as ‘ red zone ' due to COVID-19 exposure border human and mental health right violation . isolating people without adequate provision of their everyday life need can aggravate people 's stress and helplessness ( Rubin and Wessely , @card@ ; Torales et al . , @card@ ) . infectious disease bring with them heighten fear of contagion , stigma , and social ostracization of individual and community , as be see during HIV , Ebola , and related epidemic . there be existing evidence that poor mental health can be a cause and a consequence of poverty and destitution ( Lund et al . , @card@ ; Funk et al . , @card@ ) . common mental health disorder affect the wage-earning capacity of the poor as the individual 's everyday functioning be reduce ( Kleinman , @card@ ) . challenge mental health condition also reduce the wage earn potential of individual because of low employability . the absolute material deprivation can also cause depression , anxiety , or traumatic stress . we know that absolute poverty in many part of the world can be intergenerational . pandemic further hinder the capability of the poor to climb out of extreme poverty . even though mental health disorder affect 1 billion people globally , the government of the world spend only about 2 % of their health budget on address this issue . additionally , most people lack access to basic psychosocial and psychiatric treatment . the interconnection between poverty and mental health stop short of examine the health and care infrastructure and ignore the political factor that perpetuate an increase in both ( Patterson et al . , @card@ ) . the International Monetary Fund suggest that the world 's economy be project to contract by up to 8 % in @card@ , which be bad than the 2008–09 financial crisis ( IMF , @card@ ) . the emerge market and develop economy be project to contract by 1 % in @card@ . on employment , the International Labour Organization forecast that around @card@ billion worker be affect due to lockdown ( @card@ % of the world 's workforce ) ( International Labour Organization , @card@ ) . by now , several global agency and think tank have conclusively show that worker who be either extremely poor ( less than USD @card@ a day ) or poor would be hit the hard . this include refugee , migrant worker , non-farm laborer , and workforce engage through other informal activity . although government have respond promptly with relief package to keep their economy on life support and to maintain economic activity , informal worker ( about 2 billion ) be not benefit from these relief package . informal labor have @card@ % of total labor share in low-income country , @card@ % in lower-middle country , @card@ % upper-middle country , and @card@ % in high-income country . the University of Oxford 's COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index place India , Pakistan , Nigeria , and Brazil at high risk of their people fall into poverty due to their high share of the workforce operate within the informal economy ( Hale et al . , @card@ ) . poverty affect child disproportionately . One out of five child life in extreme poverty and ensure social protection for child and other vulnerable group be critical . progress in reduce working poverty have slow over the past 5 year and effort need to be reinvigorate ( United Nations , @card@ ) . the situation remain particularly alarming in sub-Saharan Africa , where the proportion of work poor have reach @card@ % in @card@ . in the least developed and landlocked develop country , at least one-quarter of worker live in extreme poverty despite have a job . employ young people ( between @card@ and @card@ year of age ) be more likely to be live in poverty , with a work poverty rate that be double than that of adult worker . the world be already struggle to achieve the target for poverty alleviation set under the globally agree agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals . conclusively , element of mental health condition determine the material condition of the affected individual who will be unable to sustain life and livelihood . in the context of a global pandemic , prevail institution and governance structure have prove to be a hindrance to the poor in the attainment of minimum material condition , thus make them increasingly vulnerable , marginalize , and sometimes even exclude from social protective net . the condition of extreme deprivation make marginalize and weak population psychologically fragile and vulnerable . a large number of poor population in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have co-morbid health condition , such as HIV , tuberculosis , cancer , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease , all of which have severe impact on emotional and physical capability that lead to a compromise psychological functioning . our commentary underscore how the world be materially deprive be severely impact due to this pandemic and the impact will likely continue beyond @card@ . the impact of COVID-19 on mental health will also hinge on the economic downturn . public mental health intervention should be formally integrate into public health preparedness and emergency response plan so that the poor and vulnerable population can be protect from spiral into an abject material condition . To break this nexus , a concerted effort to tackle mental health as a sizeable portion of overall health response be the need of the hour . the UN Secretary-General perceptively reiterate the slogan ‘ no health without mental health ' , which should be the core mandate of global development agenda ( time , @card@ ) . the mental health impact associate with COVID-19 need to be assess , quantify , and a proper response strategy need to be design in a nuanced and structured manner . the issue of mental health in poor part of the world be not well understand , and typically the remedy be also stigmatize and intervention inadequately resourced .   identification of superspreading environment under COVID-19 through human mobility datum in medical science , epidemiologist call someone who infect an especially large number of other people “ superspreaders”1 . the existence of superspreaders be notable as they can accelerate the rate of new infection in a pandemic . with COVID-19 declare a global pandemic by the World Health Organization ( who ) on March @card@ , @card@ , scientist have closely monitor and continuously update estimate of the effective reproduction number ( Rt ) , “ which represent the mean number of secondary infection that result from a primary case of infection at time t”2 . such research be necessary because Rt be an indicator of the transmission potential of a disease . a pandemic signal a decline trend only when Rt be below one . more case be expect when Rt exceed one . the high the value of Rt , the faster the transmission and the more alarming the public health risk . Rt for COVID-19 be estimate to be between two and three in early @card@ , but recent research suggest a high number in the range of @card@ to @card@ . yet , there be great inter-personal variability of disease transmission with much high transmissibility risk of a primary case by a superspreader5,6 . a superspreader in Wuhan infect @card@ healthcare worker that result in one death while an individual in Chicago who attend a dinner , a funeral and a birthday party be responsible for @card@ new infections1 . hence , research on identify , trace and treat superspreaders be highly important to pandemic control . thus far , the focus of research on superspreaders have primarily be aspatial1,6,7 . in this paper , we propose to broaden research on superspreaders through geographical model of the pandemic spread8 . figure 1 be an illustration use a hypothetical example of a city with @card@ sub-divisions/zones and with each zone carry a population of @card@ . Two scenario of spatial spread could result , assume that @card@ % of all infected case be cause by superspreaders1 , and the transmission rate of super versus non-super spreader be model at ten and two respectively ; where these value may be adjust accord to update and realistic estimate gather from field datum . Scenario A assume the presence of a superspreader in a non-superspreading environment whereas the superspreader in scenario B exist in a superspreading environment . with infectivity yield similar number of newly infect case at each time period , the spatial pattern of infection for the two scenario look very different because of the geographical setting populate by people at two extreme end of mobility . a non-superspreading environment ( Scenario A ) be characterise by people at the low end of mobility while a superspreading environment ( Scenario B ) have highly mobile individual , include long-distance commuter and those who regularly travel from place to place beyond their local community . we argue that a community/district with mobile population must also possess certain amenity or service to turn it into a superspreading environment . this be analogous to Losch modify Christaller’s central place theory9 , which suggest the location of retail in urban area attract people/consumers to purchase good and service they need ( see Supplemental Methods S1.1 ) . moreover , retail location in urban versus rural district exhibit different retail centrality , which be a measure of the retail drawing power or attraction of a give location10 . the density of street or transport network also play an important role in shape variation of retail and service intensity within a city11,12 . compare with suburban location , urban core or central business district where both high- and low-order retail and transport facility tend to cluster favour the formation of “ attractor ” in the settlement layout , exert a strong pull on consumer live nearby and further away in the region . consequently , the combined characteristic of high spatial agglomeration of retail activity and expanse transportation can serve as a proxy for superspreading environment . consider the vary spatial pattern of disease transmission under a superspreading environment , we suggest that non-pharmaceutical intervention ( NPIs ) for disease containment must step beyond the conventional practice of focus on home and workplace of the infected . unlike the traditional spatial analysis that associate patient to their home locations13–15 , this study identify candidate area with a heavy concentration of retail and public facility as potential spread environment . our approach aim to predefine high-risk area of disease spread such that these location can be target to receive more stringent and timely disease prevention and control measure before or during an outbreak . research on pandemic control have involve scientific study about the host , pathogen and the environment . under COVID-19 , scientific research on the pathogen ( such as the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ) have be ongoing at full steam although effective drug and vaccine to protect human being be still be test . it be also note that a period of at least two day of pre-symptomatic transmission in the community be particularly challenging2 . without an effective means of track asymptomatic individual , NPIs be essential component in public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic . there be recent evidence to suggest that NPIs have be effective in China and beyond2,16,17 . specifically , the COVID-19 case in China could be @card@ time high without NPIs2,18 . notwithstanding that these study have bundle all confinement or lockdown measure as NPIs , they recognize that the effectiveness of different intervention might vary . it be also realise that the economic and social cost of lockdowns can be enormous19 , as people be confine to home without be allow to participate in social , entertainment and leisure activity good for their physical and/or mental health . know that a complete city lockdown incur enormous economic and social cost , as well as related knock-on effect on physical/mental health and interpersonal violence , it may be beneficial to continue operation of some public facility deem important for maintain people’s daily life and wellbeing . study have suggest that permit limited access to sport centre , library , din out , and shopping for local resident can be manage with proper disease prevention measure , such as frequent disinfection , mandatory face-masks and physical distancing20,21 . under COVID-19 , these public facility have often be target for indiscriminate and complete close-down . refer to NPIs include in the Oxford database22 , close of these public facility may be consider as the intermediate step follow school and workplace closure , but before the most drastic measure of stay home order and complete city lockdown . this paper extend beyond current research that focus on the pathogen ( e. g. characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 ) or individual ( i. e. the host ) with a high risk to be superspreaders . it do not focus on biological characteristic of infected person ( e. g. in relation to their immune system ) but to examine the environment/space pose different health risk of a transmissible disease . it , therefore , supplement the traditional public health concern of medical science and microbiology with the spatial dimension of people-environment dynamics . against this background , this research use geospatial statistical method , originate from time geography23 , to differentiate between exceptionally “ high-risk superspreading facility ” cover wide spatial catchment area that attract user from distant location and those spend substantial period of time out-of-home , and “ local facility of the same type ” but with small spatial catchment area that mainly attract local resident and those spending short out-of-home time . first , we introduce the space–time concept and a method of identify high-risk public facility that may give rise to a superspreading environment due not only to the physical location ( e. g. near the central business district ) or the nature of facility ( e. g. being bar or shopping centre ) but also the characteristic of user ( e. g. whether they travel from a wide spatial catchment area and spend substantial out-of-home time with other user have similar lifestyle ) . even for the same type of facility like bar , some bar may be more local “ watering hole ” ( correspond more to scenario a in Fig . 1 ) while other can attract people from all over the city to hang out and socialize ( resemble more to scenario B in Fig . 1 ) . we make use of time and space information on the mobility pattern of individual in a city to aggregate the activity space ( AS ) , space–time prism ( STP ) , and the potential path area or potential risk surface for different type of activity ( see Supplemental Methods S1.4–S1.6 ) associate with the select public facilities27 . as illustrate in the leave panel of Fig . 2 , an individual’s recollection of place of visit within a day ( include home , all activity location and transit stop ) can be use to delineate a Standard Deviational Ellipse ( SDE ) which be use as the metric of his/her as ( see Supplemental Methods S1.4 ) . for measure mobility , we use the 2-dimensional rectangular area bound the AS and multiply it by the time factor . this measure of STP be a proxy for how far ( space ) and how long ( time ) an individual have take part in out-of-home activity during a day28 . the AS and corresponding STP for all individual who visit any of the six type of public facility record in the TCS database be calculate . we establish two hypothesis in relation to the different mobility characteristic of facility user . H1 : geographical agglomeration of the same type of facility tend to attract user of high mobility , as represent by large total STP . H2 : facility in the core urban area tend to be use by user with high total STP . To test the two hypothesis , the geographical agglomeration level ( low vs. high ) and the geographical location ( urban vs. suburb/new town ) of each public facility be analyse . Difference-of-means test be use to see whether the difference of AS and total STP of their respective user be statistically significant at p = @card@ . base on the six major type of public facility ( i. e. bar , shopping centre , karaoke & cinema , mega shopping mall , public library , and sport centre ) and catchment area of user with a highly mobile lifestyle , we ask whether these combination could be classify into different class of “ potential spatial risk ( PSR ) ” to differentiate superspreading environment ( see right panel of Fig . 2 ) . with spatial agglomeration ( high vs. low facility density and urban vs. suburb AS ) as the x-axis and user ' total STP ( high vs. low ) as the y-axis , each facility of the same type be assign into one of the four quadrant to indicate their PSR class ( see Group A and Group B table in the right panel of Fig . 2 ) . if the above two hypothesis hold true which suggest agglomeration as a risk factor , the high-high quadrant present the high PSR in create a superspreading environment ( red quadrant in Group A , Fig . 2 ) . however , some location with few establishment ( i. e. a lack of agglomeration or H1 be reject ) that be frequent by highly mobile individual ( i. e. H2 hold true ) may also be candidate of a superspreading environment ( red quadrant in Group B , Fig . 2 ) . class 2 PSR with high population density ( orange section for both group A & B in Fig . 2 ) signal potential location of localized outbreak because of low STP . the number of PSR class will be determine base on the datum construct . our example use two class ( low vs. high ) on each dimension to yield four quadrant in total ( with the low-low quadrant split by high and low population density ) . To reflect the superspreader characteristic of much high risk and transmission rate , we weigh the different PSR class exponentially with a base of ten to standardise and differentiate risk level . finally , the risk surface of all six public facility be integrate to produce a “ risk map of superspreading environment ” ( hereafter refer to as the “ SE-risk map ” ) for the entire city . the method can be adopt in other city with reasonably well-established datum on travel activity and public facility . the CHP host a map-centric dashboard show key information about the pandemic , with daily update ( https : //chp-dashboard . geodata . Gov . hk/covid-19/en . html ) . each case of confirm and suspect COVID-19 infection get a unique case number , with the corresponding home location indicate . the CHP and various group of scientific researcher have track infected individual and identify different “ cluster ” of COVID-19 case . at least @card@ cluster have be identify as at July @card@ , @card@ and Supplemental Table S1 list the ten large cluster . the top-ranked “ bar and music band ” cluster not only be the large so far but also among the early in affect the city . we choose to focus on these cluster and attempt to obtain more detail about the infected case from news medium and press release from the government . many of the recount of movement and activity by infected individual be incomplete due to memory lapse and possible editing/word limitation set by local news medium . the sequence of visit different location be often available from news report but the exact duration of each activity be not available . we could thus compute only the AS ( but not total STP ) in the validation analysis . generally speak , the wide be the spatial extent of activity of the confirm case link to hot spot identify by the SE-risk map , the high be the value of the current method to pandemic control and public health . we reconstruct the AS space–time trajectory of the confirm case associate with some facility of class 1 PSR to check the consistency of the finding and establish the value of the SE-risk map in screen facility base on historical travel-activity record from TCS-2011 . To estimate the value of this approach , the empirical pattern of COVID-19 case or disease cluster associate with these popular public facility be compile and the SDE represent as map for geovisualization . Mann–Whitney U test statistic be compute to ascertain the degree of correspondence ( p = @card@ ) between the actual AS of confirm case and potential as base on this approach . table 1 show the summary result of difference-in-means test for the six public facility ( see Supplemental Table S2 for detailed statistic ) . there be evidence to support both H1 and H2 for two type of public facility : bar and small-medium shopping center . these public facility be associate with user with high as and STP , especially when they exist in high facility agglomeration and in urban area ( Class 1 PSR in Group A , Table 1 ) . H1 be reject for the other four type of public facility : karaoke & cinema , mega shopping mall , public library , and sport centre . our result show that this second group of public facility be associate with user of high as and STP but in area with low facility agglomeration ( Class 1 PSR in Group B , Table 1 ) , perhaps suggest a lack of similar type of provision in the wide community . among the four type of public facility , H2 be reject for karaoke and cinema and sport centre , suggest that these facility tend to attract more mobile user in suburb compare to urban area . furthermore , our result show that the remain public facility ( i. e. , public library and mega shopping mall ) frequent by highly mobile user tend to be the more isolated establishment or location with low facility agglomeration in the urban setting . next , the full list of six type of public facility be integrate and the resultant location assign into four PSR class , as show by group A & B in Fig . 2 . these location by PSR class be visualize in Fig . 3a . of particular interest be the red triangle and orange circle represent area of superspreading environment and localized infectivity respectively . figure 3b transform fig . 3a from the point symbol representation into a risk surface or the SE-risk map with dark shading denote high risk . the number location represent empirical datum of actual disease cluster occur between February and July @card@ inclusive . by visual inspection , the actual disease cluster seem to fall in high-risk area with identifiable hotspot in Fig . 3b . To consider the empirical value of the analysis to inform policy maker , we identify two bar designate as class 1 PSR by our method and plot the AS space–time trajectory base on TCS-2011 ( Fig . 4a ) . our method show as of wide coverage indicate patron of bar be not limit to nearby resident . then , we reconstruct the AS time–space trajectory of the infected case from the same bar base on information from trace study conduct by the CHP and news report from local medium ( Fig . 4b ) . the derive as show a large spatial extent of comparable pattern . Mann–Whitney U test indicate no significant difference in the areal coverage of AS between our method and the actual occurrence ( p = @card@ ) . target the environment to complement superspreader research be need . our study illustrate the potential value of map hot spot of superspreading environment in an ex-ante manner by combine geographical setting with pre-pandemic human mobility datum . the SE-risk map can serve as a useful reference for policy maker in target facility for more differentiate NPIs . the wisdom of Dr John Snow more than @card@ year ago have highlight the importance of associate disease case ( that be , cholera ) with the location of public facility ( that be , public water pumps)29 . give the challenge of a pandemic with no effective vaccine and cure , NPIs be necessary to “ avoid peak of case that would overwhelm hospital and intensive care unit ( ICU ) capacity and result in hundred of thousand of deaths”30(p 1 ) . current observation and the global trend have indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic be likely to last for some time . it have become increasingly difficult to enforce citywide lockdowns that carry serious political , economic and social ( include health ) consequence . identify individual with the disease ( at the pre-symptomatic stage ) , reduce the time for diagnosis and laboratory test , proper isolation of the infected , and trace of the whereabouts of the individual that they have be in contact with , will remain critical in this fight against coronavirus . these persistent effort have put pressure on people’s everyday life , and the already strain healthcare and laboratory resource worldwide . One major challenge in a pandemic be the rapid and unpredictable transmission of disease associate with superspreaders . use the conceptual and methodological framework of superspreading environment , our analysis have demonstrate the potential value of integrate geographical knowledge and human mobility pattern to predict the “ origin ” of disease cluster base on the activity type , facility feature , and user ' travel-activity pattern . One limitation of the study be that we have to use travel characteristic survey datum from @card@ to analyze a pandemic of @card@ . since that year , complex change in people’s activity-travel pattern may have happen as the city’s urban form and transport system evolve . this issue may hinder the accuracy of the study . with more update datum , the result of the study would be more accurate . despite this limitation , the usefulness of the technique be validate . besides , the selection of public facility conducive to disease spread and insight derive from the potential risk surface may be more applicable to COVID-19 in particular and other respiratory pathogen in general , and somewhat relevant to infectious disease with other mode of transmission . the generalizability of the potential risk surface may thus be constrain . in term of future research direction , more factor which be know to contribute to the formation of superspreading environment , such as poor indoor ventilation , can be consider and integrate into the current analysis . in parallel , there be a need to refine the research by consider more characteristic both about the user and the facility . for the former , superspreaders of certain occupation work in a superspreading environment may result in even high public health risk . for the latter , facility locate at mixed commercial-residential area can be an extra risk factor . in addition , our current study make use of historical travel characteristic datum to compute AS and STP of individual . the widespread use of smart card and mobile device with self-tracking application and big datum analytic software can provide more refined mobility datum to construct the SE-risk map use our propose method31,32 . Nonetheless , NPIs that focus on modified human behaviour from wear mask and hand disinfection to reduce travel and social activity must go hand in hand in fight the pandemic .   COVID-19 and Acute Pancreatitis : What do surgeon Need to Know ? with reference to the clinical presentation of AP , we be yet to know the full spectrum of the pancreatic injury in COVID-19 . base on the currently available report , there can be an isolated rise in the pancreatic enzyme without any clinical or radiological evidence of AP , subclinical disease with only serological and/or radiological evidence of AP , “ pancreatitis-like clinical presentation ” , and finally , it can be an overt episode of AP ( Table 1 ) [ 3–7 ] . Wang et al . earlier report @card@ % incidence of pancreatic injury among @card@ patient with COVID-19 pneumonia . serum marker be mildly elevated ( mean serum amylase @card@ ± @card@ U/L and serum lipase @card@ ± @card@ U/L ) . however , none have abdominal pain or clinically severe pancreatitis [ 3 ] . when compare with the patient without pancreatic injury , those with pancreatic injury have a high incidence of anorexia and diarrhoea , severe illness on admission , low level of CD3+ T cell and CD4+ T cell count , and high level of serum aspartate aminotransferase , gamma glutamyl transpetidase , creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase . Liu et al . also show @card@ % incidence of pancreatic injury in @card@ severe COVID-19 case although injury be evident on compute tomography ( CT ) scan in only @card@ % case , mainly as focal pancreatic enlargement or pancreatic ductal dilatation [ 8 ] . incidence of pancreatic injury be low ( @card@ % ) in patient with mild disease [ 8 ] . however , none of the patient with pancreatic injury present with abdominal pain or have pancreatic necrosis [ 8 ] . on the contrary , severe AP have also be report ( Table 1 ) . Hadi et al . report familial cluster of COVID-19 case with two of three family member with COVID-19 have AP [ 6 ] . One of these case have no abdominal symptom but have rise pancreas specific serum amylase level that warrant further investigation , and diagnosis of AP be make on ultrasonography that show inflame edematous pancreas without gallstone [ 6 ] . Anand et al . report a case of COVID-19 who initially present with fever , cough , sore throat and myalgia [ 7 ] . patient recover from this illness but present again with abdominal symptom 5 day after the discharge . adhesive intestinal obstruction be suspect , but later , AP be diagnose on CT scan that show diffusely edematous pancreatitis . however , pancreatic enzyme assay be not do either at admission or subsequently . although author consider AP idiopathic in nature in this case , they do suspect causal relationship between COVID-19 and AP due to their temporal association [ 7 ] . none of the case report so far have necrotising pancreatitis even though some be classify as severe , and none require any intervention for pancreatitis-related local complication . various mechanism might be involve in the pancreatic injury in COVID-19 . severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) seem to have an affinity for the pancreas as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor be express in the pancreas , both in the exocrine gland and islet cell [ 8 ] . such expression have be show to be high in the pancreas than in the lung [ 8 ] . thus , pancreatic injury can result from the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 mediate by its local replication [ 3 ] . another putative mechanism involve dysregulated immune response induce by SARS-CoV-2 that target pancreas in addition to the lung and kidney cause AP besides organ failure [ 3 ] . however , organ failure can also occur in AP secondary to other cause ( e. g. biliary pancreatitis ) in a patient with COVID-19 who might otherwise be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic . such presentation can be encounter more commonly in near future with the increase prevalence of COVID-19 . lastly , AP can also result from drug-induced injury either directly ( e. g. use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) or glucocorticoids ) [ 3 , 8 ] or indirectly ( through tocilizumab-induced hypertriglyceridemia ) [ 9 ] . it be important to make the correct diagnosis of AP in COVID-19 patient although it can be difficult . isolated rise in the pancreatic enzyme in a patient with COVID-19 should not be attribute to AP without clinico-radiological correlation as such rise can be non-pancreatic in origin and can be see in gastroenteritis and lung injury also , especially in the presence of renal or respiratory failure ; condition commonly present in severe COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . rather , criterion as per the revise Atlanta classification should be use to make the correct diagnosis which require at least two of the follow three criterion : ( 1 ) typical abdominal pain , ( 2 ) serum amylase or lipase > 3 time the upper normal limit , and ( 3 ) characteristic finding on diagnostic imaging ; the latter might play more significant role in COVID-19 patient where clinical evaluation for abdominal symptom might not be feasible in severe case require intensive care unit care with ventilatory support . as target organ be same in severe AP and severe COVID-19 , acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute renal failure result from the latter can lead to inaccurate severity assessment of AP and response assessment when “ step-up ” approach be adopt to deal with local complication . in addition , occurrence of AP can aggravate the inflammatory response already induce by SARS-CoV-2 lead to accelerate organ failure . possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreatic tissue be also a concern for the surgical team . as this virus have be detect in the peritoneal fluid with a load high than in the respiratory tract [ @card@ ] , there be a possibility that this virus could also be present in the ( peri ) pancreatic fluid and necrotic tissue . in addition , viremia may not be directly relate to the severity of symptom , and all the patient , irrespective of the symptom’s severity , could have viral load in the peritoneal fluid [ @card@ ] . although the possibility of viral load in pancreatic necrotic tissue and fluid be uncertain , intervention require to manage local complication ( acute necrotic collection or wall off necrosis ) , whether percutaneous , endoscopic , or minimally invasive ( retroperitoneal/transperitoneal ) , might expose the health care worker to SARS-CoV-2 , more so with high-risk aerosol generate procedure like endoscopic or minimally invasive drainage / necrosectomy include video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement ( Vard ) . in addition , it be unknown how long virus might persist in the ( peri)pancreatic fluid or tissue that become relevant while manage symptomatic pseudocyst or walled-off necrosis once acute episode be over . surgeon should be aware of that ( 1 ) pancreas be not immune to COVID-19 though its involvement seem to be uncommon and much less as compare to digestive tract involvement ; ( 2 ) in patient with COVID-19 , elevation of the pancreatic enzyme seem to be common but can be attribute to acute pancreatitis in all the case ; ( 3 ) diagnosis of AP should follow standard criterion ( revise Atlanta ) in COVID-19 patient , although accurate severity assessment can be a problem ; ( 4 ) development of severe AP in a patient with COVID-19 be a double-trouble for both the patient and physician alike because of the diagnostic dilemma , possibility of common target organs(s ) involvement and accelerate clinical course ; and ( 5 ) those involve in the interventional management of moderate / severe necrotising pancreatitis need to be more careful give the unknown possibility of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through drain fluid or necrotic pancreatic tissue during procedure . our knowledge and understanding about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and pancreas be limit at present , but be expect to evolve rapidly give the increase prevalence of COVID-19 in the population that would allow us to formulate appropriate management strategy . at present , it be imperative for the surgeon to keep in mind the possible association between COVID-19 and pancreas as they might be involve in the management of AP at some point of time during its course .   the collateral cardiovascular damage of COVID-19 : only history will reveal the depth of the iceberg this editorial refer to ‘ All-cause mortality and location of death in patient with established cardiovascular disease before , during , and after the COVID-19 lockdown : a Danish nationwide cohort study ' , by J. Butt et al . , doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehab028 . the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) pandemic be an unprecedented global public health emergency that have dramatically change all aspect of our life . To date , the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) have infect almost @card@ million people and directly cause >2 million deaths.1 To prevent the spread of the virus and relieve pressure on healthcare service , government enforce lockdown measure . at the same time , healthcare system rapidly repurposed by redeploy resource and staff to tackle this unique challenge . these strategy limit the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 but disrupt usual care pathway for non-COVID-19 condition . the prevalence of cardiovascular disease have consistently increase over time as effective intervention have prolonged survival . despite this , they be still the lead cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , mandate ongoing effort to provide prompt diagnosis , complex intervention , structured follow-up , and uninterrupted care.2 the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic have abruptly discontinue this continuum of care for all cardiovascular condition , with potentially devastating consequence . in this issue of the European Heart Journal , Butt et al . provide an interesting analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient with cardiovascular disease in Denmark.3 use the Danish nationwide registry , the author do not find a difference in overall mortality for patient with established cardiovascular disease compare with the same period in @card@ , despite lockdown measure and healthcare reconfiguration . they find low in-hospital mortality that be , unfortunately , counter-balanced by high out-of-hospital mortality . this important contribution add to a grow literature on outcome for patient admit to hospital with cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic . furthermore , this report be one of the first to describe parallel change in out-of-hospital mortality of patient with cardiovascular condition and the temporal association with lockdown measure . the COVID-19 pandemic have affect country differently for several reason , include the timing and extent of lockdown measure , which have range from almost none to severe draconian approach . these measure be typically accompany by public health message urge the public to stay at home whenever possible . most country have struggle to manage the dramatic increase in demand for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic , and many system have be stretch significantly , to the verge of collapse . the reconfiguration of both primary and secondary care have include the redeployment of medical staff , sudden cessation of routine face-to-face appointment , interruption of establish care pathway , and reduce availability of medical facility . together with the public’s hesitancy to present to primary or secondary care , for new and established cardiovascular disease , this have result in important change in hospital admission for cardiovascular condition ( Table 1).3–22 most report have consequently describe a significant reduction in admission rate , include for acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure.3,8,14,16,17,23 patient often present late , sick , and with a high prevalence of comorbidities.5,17,23 moreover , in-hospital management change : patient with cardiovascular condition require admission be more frequently admit to general medical ward , and have short length of stay and increase complication rate for invasive procedures.7,8,14,16,19 in this situation , despite low absolute admission number , the resilience of healthcare system to accommodate patient with more advanced disease be limit , ultimately lead to high in-hospital mortality rates.5,7,13–15,19 Denmark promptly implement local restriction and experience a relatively low burden of COVID-19 compare with some other countries.3 this might have result in the preservation of specialist hospital care that , despite the reconfiguration of medical service , contribute to avoid the excess in-hospital mortality compare with non-pandemic periods.3 Nonetheless , the implication for country that have be more aggressively affected have be more unfavourable,5,7,13–15,17,19,23–25 and the finding of Butt et al.3 should be interpret in the context of the wide sequela of COVID-19 . on the other hand , less be know about out-of-hospital mortality due to cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic . To date , this be one of the few report address this important topic . as report by Butt et al . , out-of-hospital mortality be significantly high in Denmark during the lockdown , although it have a limited impact on overall mortality.3 the high out-of-hospital mortality also report in other country have be attribute to lockdown restriction and reluctance to seek medical care.3,7,24 furthermore , delayed provision of medical help result in high rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic , which be associate with increase response time and a significant reduction in advanced life support for these patients.25 together with increase in-hospital mortality , these factor have combine to worsen overall outcome and result in significant excess mortality for patient with cardiovascular diseases7,24 ( graphical abstract ) . To date , while we continue to experience further wave of the COVID-19 pandemic , exacerbate by the advent of new strain of the virus , we can only as yet hypothesize about a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the global collateral damage . the potential global implication for patient with cardiac disease relate to miss or delay diagnosis , reduce availability of routine testing , interrupted referral pathway , lack of proper and timely optimization of medical treatment , prevention of exacerbation , postpone or cancel follow-up , and reduce specialist care . similarly , disruption in research , education , teaching , training , and personal growth for healthcare professional will compound these insult . furthermore , several hitherto uncharacterized feature of the pandemic be likely to have affect cardiovascular health , include lifestyle change , reduction in physical exercise , home working , disrupt education for pupil , reduce social interaction , more perilous mental health , and socioeconomic hardship . these may play a substantial role , in both the short and long term , in how history view the interplay between the COVID-19 pandemic and cardiovascular disease . these and other , as yet undetermined , social and medical factor will undeniably contribute to the longstanding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . therefore , the available report of short-term out-of-hospital mortality be certain to be only the tip of the iceberg . while it appear crucial to continue specialist and uninterrupted medical care for at-risk group , include those with cardiovascular condition , further research be need to well understand the full scope of contributory factor to cardiovascular mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic , beyond infection rate . this information be essential to determine the good approach to care for patient , improve outcome in extreme condition , and minimize collateral damage in future outbreak . novel analysis , like the elegant one publish in this issue of the journal,3 be need and welcome to address direct and indirect consequence of the pandemic . however , while comprehensive research will help us well understand the implication for patient with cardiovascular disease , for now , the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular disease can yet be see . only history will reveal the depth of the iceberg .   “ Digital Clinical Placements ” : challenge in a Lower Middle-Income Country To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and a nationwide lockdown in Nepal , my medical school shift in April @card@ from traditional classroom-based lecture to online theory class . in these time , “ digital clinical placement , ” as propose by Sam et al,1 seem like the most plausible way of continue medical education . however , such virtual clinical placement present a set of challenge for a low middle-income country like mine . the technology require for digital clinical placement might not be as easily available in low- and middle-income country as they be in higher-income nation . before the pandemic , medical education at my institution rely on traditional lecture and “ real-life ” clinical placement . technology use be largely limit to lecture slide presentation and occasional audiovisual aid . online learning be a new method of teach and learn in Nepal . neither my country’s policy nor its infrastructure seem to have catch up with this novel modality . the Nepal Medical Council have announce that it will not accept any substitution for the usual in-person and hands-on training in a medical school . therefore , virtual clinical placement will not be consider the same as hands-on placement for completion of medical training and eligibility for a medical license . but with an increase number of COVID-19 case and a second nationwide lockdown in place , my institution decide in August @card@ to trial some practical class ( online placement ) . unfortunately , the lack of reliable Internet access and the unreliability of mobile datum prove to be a major constraint for some of my colleague who return to their village during the pandemic . a few of them have not be able to attend any or most of the online class . for the rest of us , poor audio and video quality due to slow Internet connection have affect the clarity and smoothness of the class . for example , identify clinical instrument and specimen be an essential part of our clinical placement and university examination . learn them through the pixelated video , because of poor connection and use of integrated webcams , have be difficult . moreover , the very essence of clinical placements—patient history , examination technique and finding , investigation and management plans—all of which should be include in a “ digital placement”1—seem to be lack . therefore , while the uncertainty of the future be still in place , with COVID-19 case rise and the possibility of a third lockdown , for now we be eager to resume in-person training in our institution in October @card@ .   the utility of Anti-Covid-19 Desks in Italy , Doubts and Criticism as of the 14th of September , Italy have be consider one of the more susceptible nation in term of risk of increase for Sars-Cov-2 contagion . in parallel , during the same period , about 5.6-million student physically come back to school from the last lockdown in February [ 1 ] . it be concretely hard for the Italian @card@ Covid-19 Emergency Technical–Scientific Committee to set new rule to get student back to class . arduous decision be make , especially when some barrier be difficult to be overcome . in particular , the physical distance between student would be simple to be set if classroom have be permit to host the same quantity of student with the right “ safety space ” around them . before the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown , this safety area be quantify as @card@ square meter . however , the Italian school system chronically suffer from an infrastructure deficit and this situation be due to the paucity of investment over time [ 2 ] . the Italian Ministry of Education ( MIUR ) decide to invest enormous resource in special desk to promote , in the first instance , high interpersonal distance in the classroom to avoid the risk of infection . the stimulation of innovative teaching be a secondary factor in this decision . however , these mobile desk be preferred because they permit a rapid adjustment in the classroom layout . these new desk feature a unique body , with a small inclinable mini-desk on the right side place over a support frame end with six wheel ( design to move around the classroom well ) and a rubber seat . this desk respect the standard of chair and table for educational institution ( EN @card@ and EN 1729-2:2012+A1 ) . this political decision become an opportunity for a bitter media attack on the Italian government . in fact , the reason for desk replacement be unjustified since traditional desk be not fix to the floor and their surface be design to be clean by @card@ % alcohol clean agent . from the economic point of analysis , the total provisional expense have not be never disclose . a single desk cost about @card@ euros : the global expect amount , in term of the quantity of desk replace , be predict as be about @card@ million euros . furthermore , the cost of old desk disposal have be not compute . this apparently unjustified decision , with high public spending , trigger polemic from the public . exacerbate this , a further critique be make stress that these seat be not ergonomically adapt for student . in fact , for example , no adjustment can be carry out by student use these “ new-concept ” desk . moreover , tall student with longer low limb could involuntarily induce the mobile chair to slip backwards due to the design’s inappropriate leg length . last but not least , left-handed people will have some trouble write because of the shape of the table . be there any scientific proof about the unergonomic design of these “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” ? be there any scientific proof show that these “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” avoid infection or reduce virus transmission among student ? obviously no because no study be yet do on this topic . be it really essential to incur this expense to safeguard the health of our child ? this final question probably fit with the Gospel accord to Luke “ why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye , but fail to see the beam of wood in your own ? ” , namely that the Italian government have spend a lot of money to buy new desk while leave out one of the main problem face by Italian schoolchildren , which be physical inactivity . it be well know the incremental decrease in children’s physical activity be observe in Italy despite a decrease in childhood overweight and obesity , the prevalence of which be still among the high in Europe [ 3 ] . this trend be a sort of “ syndemic ” condition that affect child of all develop country and that increase drastically during a force rest period such as the COVID-19 lockdown . with respect to scientific evidence in the literature show that the proper use of a backpack and the right preventative measure reduce physical problem and back pain in schoolchildren [ @card@ ] , no data have yet be find that suggest or confirm that the new “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” reduce the risk of contamination . with this editorial , we hope to stimulate a reflection by expert in the field of biomechanic , ergonomics and physical activity and our reader . in this optic , we speculate that after a force rest period of reduce physical activity due to the COVID-19 lock-down , the well public expense to improve the wellbeing of our child should be increase spending on encourage safe physical activity instead of buy “ anti-Covid-19 desk ” . that could lead to a low risk of child develop chronic condition relate to physical inactivity .   Association between Abo blood group and susceptibility to COVID-19 : profile of age and gender in Iraqi patient Coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) be a pandemic respiratory infection cause by a novel coronavirus term severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . it have be originate in the city of Wuhan ( Central China ) and show a global spread with accelerate rate associate with increase morbidity and mortality that seriously impact public health worldwide [ 1 ] . the disease have spread across @card@ country and up to the 15th of November @card@ , a total of @card@ confirm COVID-19 case have be report with @card@ % death rate ( @card@ case ) . the corresponding figure for Iraq be @card@ case with @card@ % death rate ( @card@ case ) . these figure rank Iraq as the 20th among other world country [ 2 ] . up-to-date , there have be no effective therapeutic medicine or vaccine that aid in control this communicable disease . therefore , it be essential to understand risk factor that may contribute to evolution of COVID-19 . epidemiological review have depict that all population be generally at risk to develop the infection . however , some susceptibility factor have be suggest to increase the risk of COVID-19 , and age may be among these factor . although all age group be at risk of develop the disease , elderly people be more likely to be severely affect by COVID-19 . child have be observe to have less severe clinical symptom , but critical illness have be find in those young than 1 year old . it have also be suggest that infant may be at high risk of severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 [ 3–5 ] . gender have be further describe as a risk factor for COVID-19 , and male tend to have a more severe disease than female . mortality rate be also high in male than in female [ 5 , 6 ] . some biological determinant of the host have\n",
            "also be consider as prominent marker associate with susceptibility to COVID-19 . among these determinant , Abo blood group have recently be introduce as important predispose factor in the development of infection [ 7–15 ] . Abo blood group and since their first discovery by Karl Landsteiner in the beginning of the last century have potentiate clinical , immunological and anthropological investigation . beyond their role in transfusion medicine , allele and phenotype of Abo system show racial- and population-based variation [ @card@ , @card@ ] . further , the risk of develop some disease be influence by allele or phenotype of Abo blood group ; for instance , blood group O in peptic ulcer , I*A allele in chronic myeloid leukemia , blood group A , B and AB in SARS , and blood group B and AB in pathogenic enteric infection . in infectious disease , host susceptibility may be relate to difference in antigen expression of blood group , which can serve as receptor and/or co-receptors for the infectious agent [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in line with these presentation , this study aim to investigate the genetic association of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) with risk of COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . in a previous issue of this journal , we suggest that group A be associate with an increase risk of death in COVID-19 case , while AB may be a susceptibility biomarker [ @card@ ] . however , the study be limit by low sample size of patient ( @card@ case ) . in order to gain a good understanding of these biomarkers in risk of disease , the sample size be increase to @card@ case . this sample size allow for Abo blood group to be re-analyze in COVID-19 case with emphasis on age and gender . thus , the confound effect of age and gender on the association between Abo blood group and evolution of COVID-19 be evaluate . during the period from May @card@ to July @card@ , @card@ , a case-control study be conduct to examine the genetic association of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) with COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . a total of @card@ patient be enroll in the study . they be admit to hospital in two major Iraqi city ( Baghdad and Basrah ) . the infection be molecularly diagnose by detect the coronavirus RNA in nasal swab of patient use a detection kit for @card@ novel coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ) RNA ( PCR-Fluorescence probe ; Da An Gene Co. , Ltd. of Sun Yat-sen University ; China ) . included patient be those with sign and symptom of respiratory disease and test positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid . patient with respiratory complication and test negative for the virus RNA be exclude from the study . datum on age , gender , and blood group for each patient be obtain from hospital record . a control sample of @card@ individual be also include in the study . they be blood donor and their anti-viral test at the Central Blood Banks ( Baghdad and Basrah ) be negative . the protocol of study be approve by the Ethics committee at the Iraqi Ministry of Health and Environment , and the guideline issue by this committee be follow . the phenotype of Abo blood group ( A , B , AB and O ) be give as number and percentage frequency . allele frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) be estimate use the software S2 ABOestimator ( http : //webpages . fc . ul . pt/~pjns/Soft/ABOestimator ) . genetic association of Abo blood group with COVID-19 be assess use logistic regression analysis ( adjust for age and gender ) and group O be the reference category . the association be express as odd ratio ( OR ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CI ) . age be give as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , and significant difference between mean be assess by one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) follow by either least significant difference ( LSD ) or Duncan 's multiple range post-hoc test . To assess the role of age in predict disease , receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analysis be perform to estimate area under curve ( AUC ) occupy by age . in this analysis , age be the test variable , while COVID-19 case be the state variable . a probability ( p)-value ≤ @card@ be consider statistically significant after apply Bonferroni correction ( pc ) . these analysis be carry out use the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics @card@ ( Armonk , NY : IBM Corp. ) . G*Power software be use to determine power of sample size . at alpha probability of @card@ and effect size of @card@ , the power of sample size be @card@ . accordingly , the representation of sample size be statistically validate . mean age be significantly elevate in COVID-19 case compare to control ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ year ; p < @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . a similar observation be make in male ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ year ; p < @card@ ) and female ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ ; year ; p < @card@ ) case , while there be no significant difference between male and female regard mean age in patient or control ( Fig . 2 ) . roc analysis demonstrate the predict significance of age in evolution of COVID-19 . the estimated AUC be @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ – @card@ ; p < @card@ ) ( Fig . 3 ) . male outnumber female in case ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and control ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) , but no significant difference be record ( p = @card@ ) ( Fig . 4 ) . however , age grouping ( < @card@ , @card@ – @card@ , @card@ – @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) reveal significant variation between case and control ( p < @card@ ) . approximately , @card@ % of COVID-19 case cluster in the age group ≥ @card@ year ( @card@ % ) . on the contrary , more than @card@ % of control be below the age of @card@ year ( Fig . 5 ) . distribution of age group in male and female case show no significant difference ( Fig . 6 ) . Abo blood group analysis show that group a be the most common among case , while blood group O be the most common among control ( @card@ and @card@ % , respectively ) . blood group A ( @card@ vs. @card@ ; pc = @card@ ) , A+AB ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ; pc = @card@ ) and A+B+AB ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ; pc = @card@ ) show significantly increase frequency in COVID-19 case compare to control . the estimated ORs of these variation ( logistic regression analysis : group A , A+AB or A+B+AB vs. O ) be @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) and @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . allele frequency of Abo blood group show no significant deviation from HWE in COVID-19 case or control . however , the case be characterize by increase frequency of p[A ] and q[B ] allele ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) compare to control ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) . conversely , the frequency of r[O ] allele decrease in case ( @card@ vs. @card@ ) ( Table 2 ) . frequency of blood group A , B , AB and O show no significant difference between age group ( < @card@ , @card@ – @card@ , @card@ – @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) in COVID case or control ( Table 3 ) . with respect to gender , these frequency show significant difference between male and female case ( p < @card@ ) . male case be characterize by increase frequency of group A ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and decrease frequency of group O ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) compare to female case . these difference between male and female be not observe in control ( Table 4 ) . therefore , Abo blood group be re-analyze independently in male and female . the analysis reveal that group a frequency elevate in male case compare to male control ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) , while group O frequency decrease ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) . logistic regression analysis ( group a vs. group O ) estimate an OR of @card@ ( @card@ % CI : @card@ - @card@ ) , and the difference be significant ( pc = @card@ ) . on the contrary , there be no significant difference between female of case and control ( Table 5 ) . this study demonstrate that age , gender and Abo blood group might be important risk factor for COVID-19 in Iraqi patient . the mean age of patient approach the fifth decade ( @card@ ± @card@ year ) , and @card@ % of patient be classify in the age group ≥ @card@ year . these finding strongly suggest that individual age @card@ year and old be at great risk to develop COVID-19 . previous study have likewise report that elderly be more susceptible to COVID-19 than young adult . further , severity and outcome of disease largely depend on age of patient . most of hospitalize COVID-19 case ( @card@ % ) be age @card@ year and old and tend to have a high risk of death ( 23-fold ) compare to young patient [ 4 , 21–23 ] . although the elderly be at a great risk of some comorbidities ( cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obesity and respiratory system disease ) , immunological dysfunctional abnormality have be introduce as risk factor for the evolution of COVID-19 in the elderly population [ @card@ ] . Two immunological outcome have be correlate with aging ; inflamm-aging and immunosenescence . in inflamm-aging , elevate level of peripheral pro-inflammatory mediator ; for instance , interleukin ( IL)-1β , IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , have be report . their elevation may drive the development and maintenance of immunosenescence , which refer to aging-related immunological change that may have detrimental effect [ @card@ , @card@ ] . probably , most disease affect the elderly ( include COVID-19 ) be due to inflamm-aging and immunosenescence , as they contribute to what have be term a cytokine storm . the cytokine storm be describe as life-threatening organ-dysfunction syndrome due to abnormal host immune response against infectious pathogen . dyspnea , hypoxemia and inflammation in major organ ( the lung , kidney , heart , liver and brain ) be prominent outcome of the cytokine storm [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in severe COVID-19 case , it have be report that vascular inflammation be a substantial cause of microvascular injury and thrombosis due to complement-associated activation [ @card@ ] . further immunological change have be associate with age . they include decline generation of CD3+ T cell , increase CD4/CD8 T cell ratio , increase regulatory T cell ( Treg ) , decrease B lymphocyte and upregulated expression of toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) . these consequence may contribute to the poor outcome in elderly COVID-19 patient [ 28–30 ] . gender can also be consider a predispose factor for COVID-19 , and male may be more susceptible to the disease than woman . among the @card@ confirm case of COVID-19 , the proportion of male be high than that of female ( @card@ vs. @card@ % ) and the male : female ratio be @card@ . consistent with these finding , a Brazilian study report that @card@ % of @card@ case be male [ @card@ ] . on the contrary , most of epidemiological review and meta-analysis study report comparable rate of COVID-19 between male and female , but male tend to have high fatality and mortality rate than female [ 5 , 6 , @card@ ] . vulnerability of man for bad outcome of COVID-19 be probably due to gender-based immunological difference between man and woman , and this may impact the woman ability to resist infection include COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . sex hormone may mediate these variation between man and woman in the susceptibility to COVID-19 . experimental datum demonstrate that female mouse treat with an estrogen receptor antagonist show increase mortality rate due to SARS-CoV infection . thus , estrogen receptor signal have be consider a critical factor in protect female mouse from the infection [ @card@ ] . the gender disparity in morbidity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patient may also be relate to sex-biased difference in the lung expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , which serve as a receptor for COVID-19 entry into cell [ @card@ ] . the gene encode ACE2 be map to chromosome X , and its expression be also influence by sex hormone [ @card@ ] . collectively , these finding may explain gender drive modification in the COVID-19 outcome . besides age and gender , this study indicate that Abo blood group determinant can be consider biomarkers of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection , and group A , A + B , and A + B + AB have be associate with a significantly increase risk . in line with these result , Chinese and American study report that group a frequency significantly elevate in COVID-19 patient compare to control while group O frequency significantly decrease [ 9 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , 15]. . further , a genome-wide association study be conduct at seven hospital in the Italian and Spanish center of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Europe , and the analysis confirm that group A be associate with a high risk of develop COVID-19 , while group O have a protective effect compare to other blood group [ 37]. . in a study from China ( Wuhan city ) , the frequency of group a be significantly increase in COVID-19 patient compare to control , while group B , AB , and O frequency show no significant difference [ 9]. . a Spanish study suggest a low susceptibility to COVID-19 for group O , while a high risk of complication be find in group B patient [ @card@ ] . Canadian datum indicate that group A or AB be associate with critical illness of COVID-19 compare to group O or B [ @card@ ] . in a previous Iraqi study conduct by our group , susceptibility to COVID-19 be associate with group AB in patient from Baghdad , while group a be associate with an increase risk of death [ @card@ ] . in an Iranian study , no association be find with group a , but a significant decrease in group O frequency be record [ 7 ] . on the contrary , no association between Abo blood group and COVID-19 be find in French and Spanish patient [ 8 , @card@ ] . however , in a meta-analysis study , it be emphasize that individual of group a be at great risk of develop COVID-19 while those of group O be at low risk [ @card@ ] . further meta-analysis suggest that individual of group a may be more susceptible to COVID-19 , while individual of group O may have a low risk of develop the disease . however , the analysis also show no relationship between Abo blood group and severity of COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . although some inconsistent result have be report , most study agree that Abo blood group be of particular significance with regard to their association with susceptibility to COVID-19 , but the molecular mechanism underlie this association have not be well describe . it have be hypothesize that the blood group impact on susceptibility to COVID-19 may depend on a differential cluster of the virus glycoprotein receptor on host cell surface , induce by ABO(H ) determinant through interaction ( carbohydrate-carbohydrate ) with the glycan motif of these receptor , and this may interfere with the binding of virus and its entrance to target cell [ @card@ ] . the carbohydrate structure of ABO(H ) blood group be not restrict to the surface of red blood cell , and other cell and tissue express these structure ; for instance , lymphocyte , endothelial cell , platelet , gastric mucosa and bone marrow . further , blood group antigen be present in secretion ( i. e. saliva ) of about @card@ % of individual ( Abo secretors ) [ @card@ ] . therefore , their involvement in physiological and pathological process may be expect during viral , bacterial and parasitic infection . further evidence depict that covalently-linked ABO(H ) structure be find in some plasma glycoproteins ; for instance , von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , and factor VIII ( FVIII ) . it have be demonstrate that non-O individual have significantly high expression of endothelial cell-associated VWF protein compare to individual of group O. The VWF expression be associate with pulmonary vascular endothelial cell and this expression be influence by the Abo determinant [ @card@ ] . in this context , elevate circulate level of VWF and FVIII have be demonstrate in patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia , and this may indirectly link Abo blood group with susceptibility to COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . similar to COVID-19 , group A have be associate with severe malaria , while individual with group O be less susceptible to the infection . further , group a individual be more likely to have debilitate age than those of group O [ @card@ ] . To gain further understanding of the ABO-COVID-19 association , Abo blood group be analyze in COVID-19 patient and control after stratification accord to age group ( < @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ @card@ year ) and gender . in the analysis of age group , frequency of group A , B , AB , and O show no significant difference between age group of patient or control . therefore , the study suggest that the ABO-COVID-19 association may not be influence by age . a similar conclusion be reach through a Chinese study , in which the COVID-19 case be divide into two age group ( < @card@ and ≥ @card@ year ) , and Abo blood group frequency show no significant difference between the two group [ @card@ ] . however , a further Chinese study report a significantly increase frequency of group a and a significantly decrease frequency of group O in patient age ≥ @card@ year compare to patient in the age group < @card@ and @card@ year [ @card@ ] . with respect to gender , Abo blood group frequency show significant difference between male and female COVID-19 case , while no significant difference be record between male and female control . a re-analysis of gender-based association reveal that male of group A be more susceptible to COVID-19 than female of group A. in fact , female patient show no significant association with Abo blood group . these finding propose a predispose role for group A to develop COVID-19 in male . in line with these result , a Chinese study report that group A be encounter more frequently in male patient than in female patient [ @card@ ] . on the contrary , another Chinese study report that group a be a risk factor for COVID-19 in female but not in male . however , the study be base on low sample size of patient and control ( @card@ and @card@ , respectively ) [ 9 ] . also , no gender-related difference be see in Abo blood group among COVID-19 patient in two study from China and Spain [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the study result indicate that blood group a may be associate with an increase risk of develop COVID-19 , particularly in male .   major bleeding complication in critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia increased thromboprophylaxis be propose to COVID-19 patient to prevent thrombosisWe assess the bleed risk of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumoniaBleeding occur later than thrombosisBleeding occur once inflammation decrease thus favor heparin overdoseWe may reduce thromboprophylaxis dose once inflammation correct to prevent bleed patient with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection , also know as coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID‐19 ) , who be admit to intensive care unit ( ICUs ) have high rate of thrombosis , particularly pulmonary embolism [ 1 ] . there be a grow body of evidence that severe COVID-19 be associate with a prothrombotic state result from endothelial dysfunction and hyperinflammation , and characterize by high level of d-dimers and fibrinogen [ 2 , 3 ] . therefore , pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis be recommend . some expert advocate intensification of anticoagulation , from prophylactic to intermediate or even therapeutic dose for high risk patient [ 4 , 5 ] . however , the associated bleeding risk be unknown . the goal of this study be to investigate major bleed complication in a cohort of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine their relationship with inflammation and thromboprophylaxis . descriptive result be express as median [ quartile 1 , 3 ] or count ( percentage ) and be compare use Wilcoxon and Chi2/Fisher test . p < @card@ be consider significant . ( BiostaTGV , France ) . Fifty-six patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia be include . they be mostly man ( n = @card@ , @card@ % ) , with a median age of @card@ [ 53–69 ] year and increase body mass index [ @card@ ( 24–31 ) kg/m2 ] . all patient undergo invasive mechanical ventilation , with prone positioning in @card@ patient ( @card@ % ) . the low PaO2/FiO2 ratio within the ICU stay be @card@ [ 59–107 ] mmHg . Seven patient ( @card@ % ) be treat with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . the simplify acute physiology score ( SAPS ) II be @card@ [ @card@ ; @card@ ] . all patient be discharge at the time of data analysis . sixteen ( @card@ % ) patient have thrombotic event whereas @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient have major bleeding , include the 7 patient with ECMO . major bleeding event include 3 deep muscle hematoma , 3 gastrointestinal bleeding event , 3 vascular catheter bleed event and one intracranial hemorrhage . thrombotic event and bleeding event occur 9 [ 3–11 ] day and @card@ [ 14–23 ] day after ICU admission respectively ( p = @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . fibrinogen concentration and d-dimers have the same biphasic evolution : they be high in all patient at ICU admission : 7 [ 6–7.6 ] g/l and @card@ [ 1056–2122 ] ng/ml respectively ; they still increase to reach @card@ [ 7.4–9.3 ] g/l and @card@ [ 3544–9380 ] ng/ml on day 5 [ 2–9 ] and day 6 [ @card@ ] ( p = @card@ ) respectively ; then , they progressively decrease . during fibrinogen increase , @card@ % of the @card@ patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation have anticoagulant overdose , compare to @card@ % ( n = @card@ ) of them once fibrinogen decrease ( p < @card@ ) . anticoagulant overdose be measure @card@ [ 3.5–9.25 ] day after fibrinogen peak . the @card@ major bleeding event occur while inflammation be decrease , after 4 [ 3–5 ] day of fibrinogen decrease ( Fig . 2 ) . similarly , d-dimers be decrease in @card@ % of the bleed patient that have 2 measure of d-dimers or more within the week prior the bleed event . all patient with major bleeding be treat with anticoagulant ( UFH n = 7 ; LMWH n = 3 ) , all but one at therapeutic dose . Anticoagulation be supratherapeutic for 6 ( @card@ % ) patient on the day of bleeding or the day before ( Fig . 2 ) . half of the bleed patient die in ICU , compare to @card@ % of patient without bleed complication ( NS ) . we report that major bleeding be common in this series of critically ill patient with COVID-19 pneumonia . most of the major bleeding event complicate therapeutic anticoagulation , as previously observe in a cohort of @card@ ICU patient where the rate of bleed event in ICU be @card@ % , with @card@ % during therapeutic anticoagulation [ 7 ] . moreover , more than half of our bleeding complication occur while heparin , initially in therapeutic range , become supratherapeutic . this might be explain by the decrease in inflammation : indeed , heparin bind to antithrombin to mediate anticoagulant effect but also bind nonspecifically to other plasma protein that compete with antithrombin . during the hyperinflammation state , markedly increase level of acute-phase-reactant protein , include fibrinogen , contribute to heparin resistance [ 8 ] . then , decrease concentration of inflammatory protein , include fibrinogen , induce increase anticoagulant effect and potential overdose . these datum highlight to carefully monitor heparin in COVID-19 patient , use anti-Xa activity preferentially , to prevent under and overdosage , especially once the initial hyperinflammation decrease . as we record datum until ICU discharge , we observe a biphasic evolution of coagulation disorder during COVID-19 : first thrombotic event during the early hyperinflammation phase , then bleed event once inflammation reduce , as confirm by fibrinogen and d-dimers decrease . although more study be need to determine when the thrombotic risk period end , these datum suggest that intensity of thromboprophylaxis may be adapt to the kinetics of thromboinflammation : intensification of anticoagulation dose may be use during the initial hyperinflammation phase as propose by many expert [ 4 , 5 , 9 ] , then standard prophylaxis may be consider once the high thrombotic risk period end and fibrinogen decrease , to prevent bleed event . despite the limitation associate with the retrospective monocenter design of our study , these datum highlight the relationship between fibrinogen level , inflammation and risk of thrombosis or bleeding and the evolution of the risk during COVID-19 hospitalization . bleeding be likely to occur later during ICU stay when inflammation be decrease and expose to supra-therapeutic level of anticoagulation . Intensivists may modulate thromboprophylaxis strategy accord to inflammatory biomarkers , especially fibrinogen . moreover , when fibrinogen decrease repeatedly , anti-Xa activity should be control to adapt heparin dose .   make sense of the Socialist Market Economy examin the model of ‘ socialist market economy ' , a core theme be naturally the relationship between socialism and market , or socialism and capitalism . the contributor to this book agree that the market have gain increase prominence in all three country , China , Vietnam and Laos . the private sector today account for a relatively large part of the output in their economy , many state-owned enterprise be or be be privatize ( or ‘ equitized ' ) and the authority have open up for private solution within health and education , sector that traditionally be the responsibility of the state , also in a number of Western market economy . the grow influence of market solution in China , Vietnam and Laos over the last 2–3 decade be part of a large international trend . the most notable international example of the neoliberal influence on earlier socialist left-oriented party be the British ‘ New Labour ' party and the early discourse about the ‘ Third Way ' . the principal objective of the ‘ third way ' be to temper free-market capitalism with social justice , while attempt to avoid an ‘ excessive domination of the state over social and economic life ' ( Giddens @card@ : @card@ ) . there have be a long-term decline in the support of social-democratic and socialist party in Western Europe . during the 2017–2018 election this decline accelerate strongly . the situation in the former socialist East and Central Europe be equally grim for the left ( Berman and Snegovaya @card@ ; Rovny @card@ ) . the weakening of the political left in Europe have be long in the making , and be largely cause by deep structural change and the decline of European manufacturing during the late twentieth century . in this process , a considerable part of the traditional electorate of left-wing party have largely disappear as a social group ( Rovny @card@ ) . the left’s shift to the centre on economic issue and its acceptance of ‘ neoliberal ' reform such as privatization of part of the public sector , cut to taxis and the welfare state and deregulation of the business and financial sector have be point to as an important explanation for the sudden recent weakening of its position ( Berman and Snegovaya @card@ ; Mudge @card@ ) . when structural change in the socio-economic landscape of Europe can have such a profound impact on European politics , it should come as no surprise that the ‘ socialist market economy ' in China , Laos and Vietnam after three decade of high economic growth and globalization have also change in fundamental way . although the communist party be still in power in these three country , their economic and social policy have be transform , and the ‘ New Socialist Man ' of contemporary China , Vietnam and Laos have change accordingly ( Chen @card@ ) , and perhaps be replace by an urban , middle-class ‘ socialist consumer ' , as Hansen argue in his chapter . the communist party in China , Vietnam and Laos be child of similar type of class-struggle that see the birth of leftist party in the West , although as note by Cole and Ingalls in this volume , they to a large extent start out as rural movement , and their strong anti-imperialist strand be different from in the West . their root go back to the interwar period . they be strongly influence by anti-imperialist struggle against colonial rule in French Indochina , foreign dominance in the nominally independent China , fight against Japanese occupation during the Pacific Wars ( 1937–1945 ) and war against the United States in Korea ( 1950–1953 ) and Indochina ( 1963–1975 ) . the peasant support base be pivotal in many of these conflict and garner through aim and action to end rural inequality . the socialist movement in Europe fragment into communist and social-democratic political party , with the latter working towards evolutionary change within the existing system , whereas the communist regime coercively make sure the socialist movement in China , Vietnam and Laos remain communist.1 in the 1990s and 2000s , in particular China and late Vietnam , become host of the manufacturing industry that have be the backbone of leftist party in the West . but labour movement in globalize Asian capitalism be mostly very weak , something that rather ironically also be the case in the socialist market economy , as Nordhaug discuss in his chapter.2 furthermore , the left and right wing political dichotomy with regard to state and market have be different in Asia than in Europe . the original East Asian developmental state model in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan remain one of the chief point of reference , both analytical and political , for those who reject the neoliberal global order.3 however , the relatively strong state-driven economic reform in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan do not take place under the rule of socialist party , but under conservative or right-wing party . Japan’s economic miracle be largely form under the leadership of the conservative right-wing Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP),4 and the developmental state in South Korea and Taiwan be to a large extent shape under right-wing authoritarian rule ( Cumings @card@ ) . hence , the role of the state versus the market in economic reform have to be understand beyond the traditional schism of the political left versus the right , or socialism versus capitalism , as understand in Europe . moreover , the economic model of Japan , South Korea and Taiwan have change as well , and there be an ongoing debate about whether the classical developmental state model still be a viable option , under deep globalization in the world economy ( Tian @card@ ; Hayashi @card@ ) . describe the socialist market economy as ‘ Market-Leninism ' , London find in his chapter that resource allocation in China and Vietnam mainly take place through competitive market while key feature of the Leninist one-party state remain in place . state actor with close affiliation to the communist party control important part of the private economy , and the divide line between private and public enterprise be frequently blur . this view be echo by Bui Hai Thiem , argue that within a Leninist political system , a neoliberal logic influence the economic programme . accord to Bui Hai Thiem , in China and Vietnam , neoliberalism and statist socialism co-exist in a highly complex and fluid context . despite these similarity , there be difference in the state’s capacity to influence and transform their economy in our three case . these difference be root in long-term pattern predate their socialist market economy . China have strong capacity than Vietnam , which in turn have strong capacity than Laos ( e. g. creak and Barney @card@ ; Vu @card@ ) . in the process of adjust their socio-economic programme to ‘ the socialist market economy ' from the 1990s onwards , the authority in China , Vietnam and Laos embrace large part of the same neoliberal reform that both the social- democratic party in Europe as well as the East Asian developmental state all implement into their party programme in the 1990s and 2000s . however , in Laos , as note by Rehbein , it be only a small part of the elite that have truly embrace capitalism while a somewhat large share of the population still conform with old socialist value . the socialist market economy ' embrace of element of neoliberalism have be drive by four distinct , yet interlink factor . first , political leader realize that the market economy could serve as a tool use to deliver progress , not a different way of organize society . second , through trade and investment as mean to economic growth , their economy be expose to global capitalism , and the integration into the world economy mean they have to fulfil obligation in international treaty to facilitate for fair trade and reduce subsidy to state-owned enterprise . third , in respond to change expectation among the public as a result of increase living standard and the breakdown of previous socialist welfare institution , the authority have gradually implement modern welfare policy ( more so in China than in Vietnam , and more in Vietnam than in Laos ) in order to ensure social stability , of which private solution be important part . fourth , development success have lead to massive structural change in the socio-economic landscape in these country , like age , urbanization and change employment pattern , and the authority have be force to respond to these change . in Europe , the socialist left embrace neoliberalism to remain relevant for the voter , while in the one-party system in China , Vietnam and Laos , the authority embrace part of the neoliberal logic as a strategy for regime survival . nevertheless , as London remind us in his chapter , although the socialist market economy reflect element of neoliberalism , their political economy be not usefully understand as neoliberal . the urban middle class , the old enemy of the socialist project of a classless society , be now a central part of the of the ‘ socialist market economy ' project , although the term class be usually avoid . the middle class , or middle-income group in party rhetoric , be incorporate into the project to ensure stability , and be see as a pillar in the transition to a more consumer-based economic model . accord to Hansen , the middle class be generally relatively satisfy with the ‘ socialist market economy ' , at least as long as it continue to deliver economic growth . the ‘ socialist market economy ' model share some similarity with European democratic socialism in embrace element of neoliberalism , and it resemble the original East Asian developmental state model in how the state continue to play a strong role govern the economy . yet , the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have some unique characteristic . One obvious distinction be the one-party system with element from the old Leninist structure , and how this inform the protection of right , and issue like transparency and accountability . the shortcoming with regard to labour right be illustrate by Nordhaug in this volume . another divergent characteristic of the ‘ socialist market economy ' be the state control of land ownership . furthermore , as discuss by Bekkevold , the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have be mould in the context of a world economy very different from the time of the classical East Asian developmental state . the strong trademark of the ‘ socialist market economy ' model may be its pragmatism with regard to socialism and the market economy . the famous slogan associate with Deng Xiaoping—‘it doesn’t matter whether a cat be black or white , as long as it catch mouse ' and ‘ let some people get rich first ' , have continue to be a strong guide throughout the reform process . the socialist legacy still have a prominent position in party document and rhetoric , but the solution be increasingly market base . the pragmatism actually go beyond embrace the market . as Rehbein discuss in detail , Laos under a socialist market economy be a hybrid of socialism , capitalism and early structure . in China and Vietnam , Confucianism , another old enemy of the communist revolution , be now embrace , connect the model with their pre-socialist legacy . despite similarity with the East Asian developmental state in term of the role of the state , China , Vietnam and Laos have be more open to trade and foreign investment in the early phase of their reform , but like their developmental state predecessor they be also able to reap the benefit of globalization through labour-intensive manufacturing . the combination of one-party rule and be late developer within the context of a neoliberal global economy have make the socialist market economy into a unique development model . the market and private enterprise be now integral part of the socialist market economy . for example , the Vietnamese Party Congress in @card@ for the first time acknowledge the contribution of the private sector to the economy , and at the 5th plenum of the Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee in @card@ , it be state that the private sector shall be treat on a par with other sector of the economy . nevertheless , at the core of the socialist market economy be the idea that the state should retain control of key economic sector . One important way of retain state control of the economy have be through state-owned enterprise , but in all three country the state be now more selective in its ownership , with a focus on strategic sector . SOEs should thus be restrict to sector such as natural resource and public utility that be not sufficiently remunerative for the private sector , and sector that be important for national defence . in Laos , the authority have undertake considerable privatization even within one of the country’s key economic sector , hydropower electricity , and electricity company still own by the state be reform into self-finance commercial entity ( Songvilay et al . @card@ ) . examin reform of state-owned enterprise in Vietnam , Knutsen and Do Ta Khanh find that since @card@ there have be attempt to speed up equitization and privatization of the SOEs . in contrast to early reform of the SOEs when Vietnamese authority largely respond to demand from external agency such as the World Bank , the policy agenda be now more motivated ‘ from within ' , drive by bad debt and corruption in state-owned enterprise . the plan be to accelerate equitization of the remain SOEs that be not engage in strategic industry , and sell a large portion of the share in already equitized SOEs and list them on the stock exchange . however , in their respective chapter , Knutsen and Do Ta Khanh as well as Bui Hai Thiem , discuss how bureaucratic obstacle and vested interest have contribute to slow down the reform . the transition from plan to market economy in China , Vietnam and Laos be slow in the financial sector . in his chapter , Bekkevold discuss how the state largely remain in control in banking , finance and monetary policy , and that the state in all three country willingly intervene and regulate the capital market and their stock exchange . China , Vietnam and Laos have try to develop policy that both embrace the global economy and at the same time shield their political system and economy from too much exposure and pressure for reform . they be able to take advantage of be latecomer , integrate into global value chain through trade in good and facilitate for inward FDIs , and view trade and incoming FDI as necessary tool for economic growth without lose too much control of their respective economic policy , whereas they have take a more careful approach embrace capital market deregulation and foreign portfolio investment . the severe economic and political consequence of the Asian financial crisis convince them to strengthen their banking and financial system , but also to maintain a more careful approach towards financial globalization . the stock market in all three country be comparatively new phenomenon , and although foreign participation in their stock and bond market have rise in recent year , it remain relatively low compare with international peer . still , the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange be already among the large in the world in term of market capitalization . as Bekkevold note , such a fast growth of newly establish stock exchange with immature regulatory agency , human resource , auditing and reporting would cause grow pain in any country . as discuss by Bekkevold , the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund all point to vulnerability in the financial system of China , Vietnam and Laos . building institution , regulatory agency , law and competence to run a market economy take time , and be still very much an unfinished business in all three country . the ‘ socialist market economy ' model have fail with regard to environmental sustainability , at least up to this point in history . the rapid economic development have take a heavy toll on natural resource and the environment in China , Vietnam and Laos . the enormous scale of China’s economic growth have turn it into the world’s large emitter of climate gas , contribute to environmental degradation on a global scale . emission be increase rapidly also in Vietnam , although on a small scale . furthermore , in all three country , climate change and natural disaster threaten to undermine development . Cole and Ingalls indeed note that Vietnam’s and China’s exploitation of land and natural resource to meet economic priority have begin to take hold across the border in Laos , point to grow environmental and human impact as intensive commercial agriculture have expand into marginal rural space . while China and Vietnam have have some success in reforestation , they have export deforestation to Laos , which have become a frontier for investment in exploitation of land and natural resource in the Mekong region . the abundant river of Laos be be dam accord to the government’s target of become the ‘ battery of Asia ' , and although hydropower be a clean energy source and the policy be present as ‘ green growth ' it have irreversible environmental impact , undermine the viability of fishery in the river , displace livelihood and riverine farming and fishing community . in addition , Ortmann remind us that Vietnam be one of the most affected country when it come to climate change , with flooding of coastal area , salinated water destroy farming area and extreme drought . by @card@ , almost ten per cent of Vietnam’s population be expect to be affect by coastal flooding ( UNDP @card@ ) . climate change will also seriously affect economic growth and livelihood in China as well as in Laos . explain the reason for the relatively bad environmental protection record in the socialist market economy , Ortmann in his chapter point to how economic growth have be the basis for the legitimacy of the regime , to the detriment of environmental sustainability . moreover , there be a lack of checks-and-balances in the system , and many within the government have profit disproportionately from exploitation of the environment as the economic growth take off to unprecedented height . furthermore , authority have have low environmental awareness , with a shortage of skilled personnel within the government to implement environmental programme . Nonetheless , the situation be not totally dark . China be seemingly take the environmental challenge seriously . it be now take leadership in international climate diplomacy , which be a huge step forward from only one decade ago . after the COP @card@ meeting in Copenhagen in @card@ , China be accuse of ‘ hold the world ransom ' and see by many as a climate laggard ( McCarthy @card@ ) . today , China be an indispensable party to all matter concern global climate change ( Kaneti @card@ ) . China have implement a wide set of policy in sector like energy , mining , food , forestry and water to rectify decade of environmental neglect , and it be work towards a change in its energy mix with a large percentage of green energy ( Bekkevold and Tunsjø @card@ ) . however , it will take a long time before China run on green energy . for instance , coal consumption peak in China in @card@ , and government effort to improve the energy structure see coal use fall for a number of year . the decline halted and consumption rise again in @card@ , suggest China at time will de-prioritize energy saving and emission reduction to keep its economy run ( Hao and Baxter @card@ ) . Vietnam’s environmental governance capacity be not as strong as in China , but as Ortmann discuss in his chapter , environmental sustainability start to climb high on the agenda of Vietnamese policymaker after the turn on the century . accord to Ortmann , Vietnam’s authority have strengthen the power and professionalism of environmental agency , implement a number of legal reform , and build a strong partnership with corporation , NGOs and foreign donor in order to benefit from their resource and skill . similar to China , a focus on renewable energy—mainly hydro but increasingly also solar—coexists with large , state-owned coal and petroleum sector . in all three country , China , Vietnam and Laos , environmental sector management be relatively inclusive sector in the sense that the public be be consult and involve in policy to a large extent than on other matter . Ortmann point to the rapid growth of new societal actor in Vietnam as the clear indicator of the evolve governance structure , and these group be start to play an unprecedented role in policymak and implementation . activism outside of the state apparatus on environmental issue have be tolerate and even sometimes encourage . in addition , there have be an increase in environmental protest in local community , and in some case the public have be successful in pressure local government and business to comply with environmental regulation . the emergence of social medium have also help activist to mobilize community for environmental cause . a similar development be observe in China . in @card@ , the Xi Jinping administration fully embrace the concept of ‘ ecological civilization ' , which have be promote as an ideological framework for guide the future of Chinese politics and society . in @card@ , the Chinese government revise the Environmental Protection Law for the first time since @card@ . the modified law strengthen environmental protection by fine polluter . Ngo be permit to bring public interest lawsuit against those who violate the law , while local official be hold accountable for the environmental standard in their region ( Mühlhahn @card@ ) . these initiative from the political centre contribute to increase public awareness , and within this framework there be space for protest and negotiation at the local level between authority and citizen ( Hansen and Liu @card@ ) . there be a ‘ mixture of authoritarian and democratic feature ' at the implementation stage of environmental policy in China ( Ahlers and Shen @card@ ) . that say , China’s ‘ environmental state ' be find to be strong in rhetoric and strategy yet often weak in implementation ( Turiel et al . @card@ ) . the environmental sector in China , Vietnam and Laos be global both in term of increasingly contribute to global climate change , as well as in how the authority in these country now engage with the international community to address the challenge . as Ortmann and Cole and Ingalls show in their respective chapter , a wide range of international actor , include government , international organization like the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and various United Nations agency , large multinational corporation and civil society organization such as the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , participate in the policymak process and the implementation of environmental policy . China have the most unequal income distribution of the three socialist market economy . this have be a source of grow social tension . during the leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao in the early and mid-2000s , the government roll out a series of social policy initiative as a response to these tension and to stimulate domestic consumption and economic growth . at the time , unfair access to basic social service be an important reason for a grow number of local protest across the country , and people save a large part of their income to pay for basic welfare . the Chinese government abolish agricultural taxis , extended health insurance , secured access to basic education , pension and provide income support to both rural and urban resident . particular emphasis be put on reduce the gap between urban and rural population and a campaign to improve life in rural areas—‘Building a new and socialist countryside’—was launch . social policy continue to be a key instrument for the Chinese government also under Xi Jinping . as observe by Dalen in her chapter , high economic growth both force and allow the Chinese government to develop a more comprehensive social policy , and she argue that China have come a long way towards a universal welfare state for all Chinese citizen . in China , the official policy be now that the government be responsible for provide basic medical service or purchase certain service , and that non-basic medical service should be provide by the market . in @card@ the Chinese government present detailed guideline on develop a large-scale industry of private health service , while non-profit civil society organization be see as an integral part of the social policy system . moreover , China be give increase priority to digital solution such as e-health and e-learning . in fact , China have emerge as one of the global leader in promote information and communication technology for education ( ICT4E ) . even though China have take important step to establish a more comprehensive welfare system , it still face daunting challenge relate to inequality . while income be distribute more evenly in Vietnam and Laos than China , their performance be also want . the elite in all three country , include the most powerful so-called ‘ cadre-capitalist ' class ( so @card@ ) , have accumulate significant amount of wealth and power . China’s wealthy be among the rich in the world , with a steady increase in the number of super rich . while this number see a slump in @card@ follow economic slowdown ( Forbes 2019a ) , the wealth of the rich among them have continue increase ( Forbes 2019b ) . Five Vietnamese billionaire make it to Forbes ' list of the rich people in the world , include Vietnam’s rich person and owner of the powerful Vingroup conglomerate , Pham Nhat Vuong ( Dat Nguyen @card@ ) . the rich in Laos have not make it to the Forbes list , but the fact that former long-serving President Khamtai Siphandone be close to be a billionaire and consider the country’s wealthy man ( ProspectsASEAN @card@ ) serve as a reminder of the close connection between politics and economy also there . in his contribution to this volume , Hansen show that not only the rich , but also the new socialist middle class openly display their wealth . yet , display wealth can be risky . a number of billionaire in China have be imprison and even execute if they cross the line in term of crime , corruption or have the wrong political tie ( Anderlini @card@ ; Chao @card@ ) . smallholder farmer be at the core of the early socialist revolution . in the socialist period the farmer become rural worker in collective agriculture , although the depth and duration of collectivization vary between country and region . during the market reform farm family receive use right to land , and smallholder family agriculture become the prevalent model of the socialist market economy . rural income growth lag behind urban growth in the market reform . this trend have however be reverse in China and Vietnam , although the urban–rural income gap remain high . in Vietnam the average urban to rural income ratio decline from @card@ in @card@ to @card@ in @card@ ( CEIC , N. D. ) in China urban–rural income disparity peak in @card@ and have decline since then . the average urban to rural income ratio be @card@ in @card@ ( Naughton @card@ : @card@ ; China Statistical Yearbook : table 6–11 , 6–23 ) . datum be more sparse when it come to Laos , make a comparison difficult , but urban–rural inequality in term of consumption be grow from a relatively low start point during the period 2007/2008–2012/2013 ( World Bank @card@ : 2 , Table 4 ) . there be obvious and stark inequality between ethnic majority and minority population , and ethnic minority be grossly overrepresent in poverty statistic in all three country ( Banik and Hansen @card@ ; Pimhidzai and Houng Vu @card@ ) . another challenge be the transformation of the labour market , with more people employ in the so-called ‘ grey economy ' outside the established social safety net . Labour-intensive production with low-cost labour , mainly from rural migrant , have form the backbone of the export-oriented industrialization model in China and Vietnam . as Nordhaug show in his chapter , party-controlled labour union have not allow for the countervail force of labour union against employer , result in the economic growth take place under often dire condition for the worker . interestingly , Nordhaug demonstrate that Vietnamese local authority be more favourably incline to the demand of worker than their Chinese counterpart . Nonetheless , labour contract in the manufacturing industry guarantee access to basic service for an increase number of worker , but this be change as the economy move away from traditional industry towards service and innovation , particularly in China . look into the future , it will be increasingly challenging for the socialist market economy to fund the grow demand for welfare , as be the case for many Asian ( and indeed also American and European ) country . this be the case in China , where the growth be slow . and in all three country increase live standard have change expectation towards high demand , particularly from the emerge middle class . China be soon home to the large middle class in the world , and Vietnam have perhaps the most rapidly grow middle class in Southeast Asia . in his chapter , Hansen argue that to keep the middle class satisfy , the socialist market economy be more dependent than ever on deliver development , and as Dalen remind us , this also include welfare service . at the same time , China continue to face serious population challenge such as low and decrease fertility , a rapidly grow elderly population and a shrink labour force . in the year to come , further tax reform will be crucial in the financing of an ever expand Chinese welfare state , but Dalen observe that as for now , the willingness to pay individual tax be low in China , mean that indirect taxis and company tax be important source for financing welfare . moreover , there be a preference in China of the government as the main provider of welfare service , present the government with a challenge in promote non-state actor as key in the service delivery . in the transition to an economy drive by service and consumption , where innovation , technology and education will be key , new ‘ winner and loser ' will emerge in the socialist market economy , and new social risk can arise . China , Vietnam and Laos share the core characteristic of the ‘ socialist market economy ' model present earlier in this chapter . the one-party system be in place in all three country , as be the restrictive regime with regard to land ownership . they have all embrace important element of neoliberalism , but with the state still in control of key sector of the economy . for instance , they have all be relatively open towards trade and incoming foreign direct investment , and share similar reservation with regard to liberalization of their bank and finance sector as well as monetary policy . China , Vietnam and Laos have all be late-developers and pursue state-led strategy in a global context of neoliberalization . the three country have to different extent be able to take advantage of their latecomer position , particularly in term of attract foreign investment . China have manage to develop a strong domestic industry sector and be move towards high-tech , while Vietnam have face a ‘\n",
            "stalled transition ' ( Masina and Cerimele @card@ ) and mainly be able to develop a FDI-led labour-intensive industry sector which to a large extent depend on foreign technology . Laos be in this regard the odd one out , and have hardly see any industrial development . remain a largely agrarian and resource-exporting economy , the country’s development strategy and path have diverge significantly from those of its two considerably large and more powerful neighbour . furthermore , unlike China , Vietnam and Laos be heavily reliant on foreign aid in the early phase of reform , and Laos to some degree still be . the liberalization of trade and investment have facilitate for close economic cooperation between China , Vietnam and Laos , both through bilateral channel , between Vietnam and Laos within the framework of the ASEAN Economic Community , and with China through the China–ASEAN Free Trade Area . Nonetheless , as Bekkevold elaborate on in his contribution , China , Vietnam and Laos have historically have a complex relationship , and some disagreement continue to shape and limit their level of cooperation . One controversial issue be the dam of river in Laos , which take place with strong Chinese involvement , and with mainly negative consequence for Vietnam ( see Rfa , @card@ for a useful overview ) . due to the impact of dam on water level in the Mekong , Vietnamese authority have long be critical towards hydropower development in Laos , but Vietnam be also concern about China’s increasingly strong foothold in Laos , Vietnam’s historical ally . interestingly , in @card@ , the state-owned oil company PetroVietnam decide to invest in the construction of a large dam close to Luang Prabang in Laos , despite official Vietnamese statement against further dam of the Mekong . it be uncertain whether this decision be drive by commercial or geopolitical motive ( Fawthrop @card@ ) . China have emerge as the most important economic investor and developmental partner for Laos . although Thailand remain Laos ' main trading partner , China’s position in Laos be expect to be further enhance by the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) . Laos , as well as Cambodia ( Pang @card@ ) , seem to be drift into China’s sphere of influence . the situation be different with regard to Vietnam . for historic reason , there be still strong anti-Chinese current among the Vietnamese population , and as both Bui Hai Thiem and Bekkevold point to , they have overlapping claim in the South China Sea that go to the core of national security concern in both country . Vietnam seem to have more will and ability to resist a strong Chinese influence than Laos . the degree of cooperation between China , Vietnam and Laos and the coherence of their model , will continue to be shape partly by national characteristic and priority , and partly by the international context at any give time . in the next and final part of this chapter , we will look at some potential development and research agenda with regard to the future of the socialist market economy , at both the domestic and international level . an exhaustive list of future research agenda relate to the development of China , Vietnam and Laos be beyond the scope of this brief summary . yet we identify three broad cluster of issue that will be of importance ; economic development strategy ; political development ; and the positioning of these communist regime within a change international environment . development in these three cluster be closely connect and will influence each other . let us first look at economic development . China be in the midst of several transition of its economy , from export-driven to consumption-driven growth , from high growth to sustainable growth , and from labour-intensive to innovation-driven growth , and it be do so with a mix of state and market , and eventually Vietnam may face many of the same challenge as China in their industrial upgrading . One development to follow with particular scrutiny be the role of the state in innovation ( Baark @card@ ) . China have a very ambitious high-tech agenda , include the ‘ make in China @card@ ' programme . this be at least so far mainly a state-led industrial policy that seek to make China dominant in global high-tech manufacturing ( McBride and Chatzky @card@ ) . many of the sector in this programme be view as strategic industry , and the state be firmly in the grasp of it through an ‘ elite empire of state-owned enterprise ' ( Baark @card@ ; Naughton and Tsai @card@ ) . as a response to harsh criticism from the United States , call the ‘ make in China @card@ ' a subsidy-stuffer to advance China as a global technology leader at U. S. expense , China have downplay the policy , but not change it ( Wei @card@ ) . To the extent that China’s entry into the fourth generation industrial revolution and the introduction of artificial intelligence will be state dominate or more a mix of state and private entrepreneur will be important for the future of its economic model . in Vietnam there have so far be much talk of develop a domestic high-tech agenda , and there have be attempt to use the state-owned corporation sector to strengthen upgrade yet industrial policy have largely be miss , or unsuccessful . One important exception to this rule appear to be Vietnam’s state-owned telecommunication industry ( Ngo @card@ : @card@ ) . economic upgrading may be necessary to sustain the human development of the socialist market economy , but it be probably not sufficient . as argue by Nordhaug in his chapter , the socialist market economy face an uneasy balance between ‘ accumulation ' and ‘ legitimation ' . this apply not only to industrial relation , but also to welfare and sustainable development . human development and sustainable development will be important to avoid labour conflict , conflict over land and environmental protest that may not only disturb economic development but also result in instability . it remain to be see to what extent responsiveness towards popular concern and increase attention to environmental governance will contribute towards mitigate the so far dramatic environmental unsustainability of the socialist market economy . the second cluster of issue that will inform the future of the socialist market economy be political development . due to the continued one-party system in China , Vietnam and Laos , special attention have to be give to political development within these country . in multiparty system , the emphasis on state versus market solution will move in cycle depend on whether the government be predominantly leave or right wing . as allude to in our introduction , the gradual and evolutionary introduction of market reform in China , Vietnam and Laos have not be linear either , and each country have face crossroad where they have halt , turn or even reverse the process . Bui Hai Thiem call this the ‘ double movement of accommodate and resist neoliberalism ' . the political-economic cycle in the socialist market economy be not drive by change of government , but by internal disagreement , fraction , leadership priority or reaction to internal or external shock , like for instance the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s . in this volume , Rehbein describe how Laos since its Tenth Party Congress in @card@ seem to have return to a more socialist agenda , and the agenda be push by the remain hero of the revolution of @card@ . a grow number of report argue that particularly China—but also Vietnam ( Amnesty International 2018)—has rather become more rigidly suppressive in recent year ( McGregor @card@ ; Economy @card@ ) . in China , the Communist Party be see as take on a large role in all aspect of society and governance ( Batke @card@ ) , and the separation of party and government initiate under Deng Xiaoping be now be reverse , drive China in the direction of neo-socialism with a fusion of party and state responsibility ( Brødsgaard @card@ ) . China be attract attention globally for its method and innovative way of police society , include through its social credit system which be often portray as a dystopian nightmare resemble an Orwellian ‘ big brother ' society ( Mosher @card@ ; Chorzempa et al . @card@ ) . furthermore , there be a concern that the all-powerful leadership of Xi Jinping be weaken institutional governance ( Shirk @card@ ) , and it be even suggest that China have enter into some form of crony capitalism ( Pei @card@ ) . there be an inherent danger in top-down drive system of suppress development . the future role of the expand middle class , as discuss by Hansen in this volume , merit further research , include on how it might influence political development . so far , however , the middle class seem to be ‘ very much of the system ' ( Gainsborough @card@ : @card@ ) . the uneasy relationship between the moral expectation in party rhetoric towards responsible consumption and the embeddedness of increase consumption in the socialist market economy will also be important , particularly since the consumption pattern of these new middle class will have global environmental consequence . another topic to follow be the debate about authoritarian resilience , and the ability of the regime to adapt to the change environment ( Fewsmith and Nathan @card@ ; Nathan @card@ ; McGregor @card@ ; Shambaugh @card@ ) . the third main cluster of issue that will shape the future of the socialist market economy be large event and structural change at the international level . the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and the global financial crisis a decade later in different way inform development in China , Vietnam and Laos . even though the Asian financial crisis discredit the East Asian developmental state model at a global level , China , Vietnam and Laos interpret the crisis differently , and in the process of strengthen their financial system , they make sure that the state remain in control of the bank and finance sector ( Wong @card@ ) . the global financial crisis , at least as see from Beijing , increase the confidence in their own state-driven model , but it again lead to another round of debate on how to safeguard ‘ financial sovereignty ' ( Li and Zhou @card@ ) . the world economy be now face another type of international challenge , in the form of the Covid-19 virus . it bring two lesson for China , and possibly for the socialist market economy as model . first , the foot-dragging management of the outbreak of the virus in China will lead to internal criticism and demand for increase transparency , similar to what happen in the aftermath of the SARS in @card@ ( Chi @card@ ) . second , the effective manner in which the Chinese government have manage to contain the spread of the virus will certainly contribute to boost the confidence of the leadership in Beijing with regard to its own model . although originate in China , the virus have large consequence outside of China . at the time of writing , it be too early to comprehend the consequence of what be unfold , but Chinese authority have manage to largely contain the spread of the virus to one single province , while in most other country , and in particular in Europe and in the United States , the virus be spread across large part of the country . it mean that whereas China can do with a local shutdown of activity , other country have to implement a nationwide shutdown for an extended period , with long-term and wide-ranging economic consequence . already , a few week into the crisis , it be speculate that the Covid-19 crisis will further increase the standing of China on the international scene ( Campbell and Doshi @card@ ) , and end globalization as we know it ( Farrell and Newman @card@ ) . in that case , the Covid-19 crisis will reinforce structural change in world politics that have be unfold for some time already , as discuss by Bekkevold in his contribution to the volume . develop market economy be increasingly sceptical towards China’s economic model , criticize China’s use of state subsidy , unfair trade policy and manipulation of the currency . the United States have since the 1990s continuously convey this criticism towards China , but due to China’s recent arrival as an economic competitor and rival , the United States be now more willing to follow up its criticism with actual policy , and Europe and other developed country have turn more critical towards China . in the United States and Europe , the demand for protectionism be grow . in January @card@ , the United States and China reach a Phase-1 commercial agreement that bring to close their intense trade war , but it be argue that this deal may only be a short-term solution , and that the U. S. – China relationship increasingly will be characterize by a more permanent situation of economic competition and rivalry . at the core of the U. S. – China rivalry be China’s rise as peer-competitor , and not only in economic term , but as a military power . the United States be respond to this by move military asset to Asia , and by decoupling part of its economic tie to China . world politics be move from an era of deep globalization to a world more characterize by a political and economic divide between the United States and China . if this scenario unfold , it will have consequence for how connected China will be to the world economy , and the balance of state and market in its development model . during China’s trade war with the United States a number of foreign-invested enterprise move their operation from China to Vietnam . Nonetheless , in a more long-term outlook , a political-economic divide between China and the United States will place Vietnam as well as Laos within China’s sphere of influence .   downfall of Chemical Probes Acting at the Kinase ATP-Site : CK2 as a Case Study the catalytic domain of protein kinase consist of two part , the N-and C-terminal subdomain ; it be between these two subdomain , which be connect by a hinge linker , that the ATP-site be form . the N-terminal subdomain be mainly comprise of β-strands which close off the top of the active site , as well as a crucial α-helix , ( αC ) ; the C-terminal subdomain predominantly consist of α-helices ( Figure 1 ) . a “ gatekeeper ” residue in β-strand 5 ( β5 ) and a Lys in β3 form a divider , or a “ gate ” , between the front and the back of the catalytic pocket ( Figure 1 ) . access to the back of the pocket be control by the gatekeeper residue . if the gatekeeper be small ( e. g. , Ala ) the back of the pocket be accessible ; however , if it be a bulky residue ( e. g. , Phe ) , entry to the back of the catalytic pocket be obstruct . the Lys residue in the β3 strand ( Figure 1 ) be conserve in all kinase and be necessary for the catalytic activity of the enzyme ; the Lys help to secure the phosphate of ATP in the active site [ @card@ ] . the hinge linker contain a highly conserve Gly rich motif ( GXGXδG where δ be usually Tyr or Phe ) ( Figure 1 ) . the small size of the Gly residue allow the linker to come into close proximity with ATP and favourable interaction be form between the peptide backbone and the phosphate group of ATP [ @card@ ] . due to the well understand structure of the ATP site of numerous protein kinase , as well as the obvious effect on catalytic activity of the site , the development of ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor have be an active field over the past few decade . however , due to the highly conserve nature of the ATP-site , selective inhibition of protein kinase via active site inhibitor be extremely challenge to achieve [ @card@ ] . a large number of inhibitor target the ATP-site bind with donor-acceptor interaction to the conserve hinge region of the protein that naturally bind the adenine moiety of ATP ; bind to this region can produce strong interaction but often lead to more indiscriminate inhibitor [ @card@ ] . One of the first ATP-competitive inhibitor identify be staurosporine , a microbial alkaloid which in @card@ be find to inhibit protein kinase C ( PKC , IC50 = @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] . at the turn of the century , many cell permeable protein kinase inhibitor be regard as “ selective ” and be be use in cell assay to investigate the biological role of the protein kinase they target . however , in @card@ Davies et al . investigate the selectivity of @card@ commercially available “ selective ” protein kinase inhibitor and find that , exclude rapamycin and PD @card@ , all other inhibitor affect at least one other protein kinase , with most alter the activity of multiple . they also highlight that it be frequently not just closely relate kinase in the same family that be affect [ @card@ ] . these result be further build upon by Karaman et al . who screen @card@ kinase inhibitor against @card@ kinase . astonishingly , they identify staurosporine as a strong inhibitor of over @card@ % of the kinase panel test and thus , it be deem to be a pan-kinome inhibitor [ @card@ ] . although this be an extreme example , it highlight the great similarity amongst the kinome and the promiscuous nature of many ATP-competitive inhibitor . an alternative method of ATP-site inhibition develop by the Shokat group involve mutate the highly conserve gatekeeper residue of a protein kinase to a small Gly or Ala to create a uniquely targetable mutant kinase [ @card@ ] . this in theory facilitate the identification of specific inhibitor for each kinase . however , the inhibitor be typically only effective against the mutant kinase and thus , although an effective method for specifically modulate the activity of individual kinase , it do not represent a valid therapeutic strategy at this time . despite the challenge in their development , successful ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor have be develop , with more recently be approve for clinical use by the FDA [ @card@ ] . however , the majority of these compound have undesirable side effect and be use for the second-line treatment of cancer , where initial treatment have be unsuccessful [ @card@ ] . these compound be of great clinical importance ; however , the ultimate goal be the development of fully selective inhibitor with minimal off-target effect , make for a highly target therapeutic which be applicable in more than just the worst-case scenario . additionally , effective chemical probe for a wide variety of protein be require to thoroughly investigate biological pathway ; compound deem sufficiently selective as therapeutic agent may still not be effective chemical probe , provide convoluted result arise from the modulation of the activity of more than one protein . as such , highly selective molecule be need to successfully determine the specific role that different protein play in the biochemistry of live organism . casein kinase 2 , now commonly know as CK2 , be a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase belong to the CMGC group of kinase [ @card@ ] . CMGC kinase be typically involve in cell-cycle regulation , cell signal , cell communication and cell growth [ @card@ ] . CK2 phosphorylates over @card@ substrate and , as with other CMGC kinase , have multiple role in the cell cycle , include in cell growth , proliferation and survival [ @card@ ] . interestingly , unlike most other protein kinase , CK2 be constitutively active ; it do not require phosphorylation to exert its function [ @card@ ] . One of CK2′s key role in the cell be as an anti-apoptotic protein and , as such , it be see to be overexpressed in a wide variety of cancerous tumour include , but not limit to , lung , colorectal and prostate cancer [ @card@ ] . both healthy and cancer cell make use of CK2 , however , cancer cell be particularly sensitive to CK2 inhibition due to the absence of alternative pathway to compensate for its downregulation [ @card@ ] . promisingly , a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor , CX-4945 , be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma [ @card@ ] . it should also be note that , although the role of CK2 in cancer have be the most widely study , CK2 be also implicate in many other disease , include COVID-19 [ @card@ ] . CK2 have a heterotetrameric quaternary structure make up of two catalytic kinase subunits ( α and/ or α ' ) and two regulatory subunits ( β ) ( Figure 2 ) [ @card@ ] . CK2α and CK2α ' be code for by distinct gene and differ in their sequence mostly at the C-terminus ( CK2α have a longer C-terminal extension ) . they both act as catalytic unit in their own right and can come together in any combination to form the heterotetrameric holoenzyme , i. e. , ααββ , α’αββ , α’α’ββ [ @card@ ] . the β subunits control the substrate specificity and cellular localisation of the enzyme , as well as provide stability , while the α subunits phosphorylate the enzyme’s substrate [ @card@ ] . the structure of the catalytic subunit resemble that of a generic protein kinase , as describe previously ( Figure 2 ) . CK2α exist only in an active conformation without the need for upstream phosphorylation , unlike the majority of protein kinase which have an “ on ” and “ off ” form , reflect its constitutive activity . the N-terminal region link the two subdomain and cross the catalytic site , form favourable interaction with both the activation segment ( Asp175 to Glu201 , ( Figure 1 ) ) and a basic cluster of residue in the αC helix that recognise its substrate ( Lys74 to Lys83 , ( Figure 2 ) ) , stabilise the active conformation ; the close contact of the N-terminal region and activation segment be unique to CK2 and may contribute to the constitutive activity of the protein [ @card@ ] . the structure of the ATP site have lead to it historically be the main site for which inhibitor be develop [ @card@ ] . the heat map in Figure 3 quantitatively highlight that the vast majority of CK2 inhibitor develop to date bind to the ATP-site of CK2α , a handful to area surround the ATP-site and almost none to the opposite face of CK2α ( Figure 3a ) . the constitutive nature of the protein mean that the structure be always ready to accept an ATP-like molecule [ @card@ ] . additionally , the knowledge of the structure of both the active site and its natural partner , ATP or GTP , remove the problem associate with de Novo inhibitor design [ @card@ ] . as such , many ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK2 have be identify to date , include the orally available small molecule CX-4945 ( Figure 2 ) which be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma [ @card@ ] . this review focus on the most influential ATP-competitive inhibitor develop for the protein kinase CK2 , their synthesis , advantage and disadvantage and the new approach be utilise to render ATP-competitive inhibitor more successful . To the good of our knowledge , this be the only review that cover the discovery in the field that have take place in the last eight year [ @card@ ] . 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) be a nucleoside analogue , first identify as be biologically active in @card@ [ @card@ ] . the synthesis of DRB be well know in the literature with multiple facile route report , one of which be show in Scheme 1 [ @card@ ] . the inhibition of CK2 by DRB be detail by Zandomeni et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . however , DRB display only modest activity against CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ μM ) [ @card@ ] and be capable of inhibit multiple other kinase , such as CK1 , with comparable efficacy [ @card@ ] . in addition to this , DRB be also find to bind to the CK2α/β interface [ @card@ ] . as such , due to its promiscuity both in bind to CK2 and other kinase , DRB have limit use today . nevertheless , since its discovery , DRB have be the start point of many study to develop more potent and selective CK2 inhibitor , and many of the most widely use CK2 ATP-site inhibitor use currently be derive from DRB . the first major advance on DRB come from two primary improvement be make : the removal of the sugar moiety and the replacement of the chlorine atom with bulky bromine lead to the development of 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole ( TBB ) [ @card@ ] . the synthesis of TBB be first describe by Wiley and Hussung in @card@ by the combination of bromine and nitric acid with benzotriazole ( Scheme 2 ) [ @card@ ] . despite its somewhat simplify structure , TBB have a greatly improve potency compare to DRB ( Ki = @card@ vs. @card@ μM , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . it be originally believe that TBB be selective for CK2 , as deem against a panel of @card@ kinase [ @card@ ] . however , since then , the kinase panel available for testing have drastically increase [ @card@ ] and in a subsequent screen against a panel of @card@ protein kinase , seven be inhibit significantly ( >90 % , @card@ μM of TBB ) and six of these be inhibit more strongly than CK2 itself , which have 6 % residual activity [ @card@ ] . another concern with TBB be the possibility of cumulative toxicity arise from its large number of halogen atom although , thus far , this issue have not be see and TBB be not find to be toxic to mouse [ @card@ ] . despite its shortcoming , TBB be a drastic improvement on DRB and have be widely use in vitro and in vivo to gain a great understanding of the biological role of CK2 [ @card@ ] . TBI ( 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole , also know as TBBz ) be synthesise under the same condition as TBB ( Scheme 3 ) [ @card@ ] and be first discover as a CK2 inhibitor by Szyszka et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . it be later revisit as a possible CK2 inhibitor simultaneously by Andrzejewska et al . and Zień et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . TBI be find to be more active than the previous good inhibitor TBB ( Table 1 ) , as well as more selective , in particular against PK60S [ @card@ ] . a subsequent systematic structure-activity relationship study conduct on TBI and its derivative by Pagano et al . lead to the development of 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( DMAT ) [ @card@ ] , which be significantly more potent than TBB ( Table 1 ) , particularly in cell [ @card@ ] . DMAT can be synthesize in three step from 2-mercaptobenzimidazole via the complete bromination of the imidazole follow by installation of the dimethylamine functionality ( Scheme 4 ) [ @card@ ] . due to its significantly improve activity compare to TBB ( Table 1 ) , DMAT become the main ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor use after its development and analysis in the early 2000s [ @card@ ] . however , DMAT and TBI have both be show to strongly inhibit PIM1 , PIM2 , PIM3 , PKD1 , HIPK2 and DYRK1a ( all @card@ % or less residual activity with @card@ μM of inhibitor ) , as well as cyclin A/CDK2 ( ~20 % residual activity with @card@ μM of inhibitor ) . TBB be more selective toward CK2 , although it too have be find to inhibit PIM1 and PIM3 ( <10 % residual activity with @card@ μM and 1 μM of inhibitor ) [ @card@ ] . both DMAT and TBB have be widely use as inhibitor of CK2 , although it be clear that a compromise between activity and selectivity must be make when use either of these compound for biological analysis . Polyphenolic compound , such as emodin ( Figure 5 ) , be common natural product that can be isolate from a variety of plant . the first polyphenol to be identify as a CK2 inhibitor be emodin which , up until this point , be know as an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase with IC50′s of 10–20 μM [ @card@ ] . however , it be discover in @card@ that emodin be more active against CK2 ( IC50 = 2 μM , Ki = @card@ μM ) [ @card@ ] . it should be note here that some study have class polyphenols and quinone derivative as pan-assay interference compound ( PAINs ) [ @card@ ] . however , typically entire class of compound do not exhibit this behaviour , rather a select few [ @card@ ] . nevertheless , this may begin to explain the somewhat promiscuous activity of emodin . a range of study have aim to improve the polyphenolic inhibitor of CK2 , most notably identify compound 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitroxanthen-9-one ( MNX ) , 8-hydroxy-4-methyl-9-nitrobenzo[g]chromen-2-one ( NBC ) , and 3,8-dibromo-7-hydroxy-4-methylchromen-2-one ( DBC ) ( Figure 5 ) [ @card@ ] . all three compound exhibit improve activity compare to emodin as summarise in Table 2 . DBC be the most potent analogue , however , it be poorly selective . DBC be find to significantly inhibit DYRK1a , MAPKAP-K1a , MSK1 , and Prak whereas MNX and NBC be much more selective ; MNX only significantly inhibit one other enzyme , DYRK1a by @card@ % , and NBC do not inhibit any other protein by more than @card@ % [ @card@ ] . however , this study only screen the compound against a panel of around @card@ kinase and it be currently not know if they be equally selective against the rest of the kinome . MNX and NBC be test in cell and show to be equally effective at induce cell death as TBB ( DC50 = @card@ , @card@ and @card@ μM , respectively , Jurkat cell ) [ @card@ ] . another polyphenolic compound structurally relate to emodin be quinalizarin ( 1,2,5,8-tetrahydroxy-anthraquinone ) , identify as a CK2 ATP-site inhibitor through a computational screen [ @card@ ] . although structurally very similar to emodin , the activity of quinalizarin be significantly great than that of its predecessor , as show in Table 2 . in addition to its high activity , quinalizarin also display good selectivity ; when test against a panel of @card@ kinase , quinalizarin only strongly inhibit CK2 ( 7 % residual activity , 1 μM of quinalizarin ) , with no other kinase inhibit over @card@ % [ @card@ ] . finally , quinalizarin be show to successfully induce apoptosis in HEK293T cell and be faster acting than TBB [ @card@ ] . thus , it represent the most promising candidate to date from the polyphenolic class of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor . nevertheless , its activity against a large proportion of the kinome still need to be evaluate . a new series of pyrazolo-triazines be design as CK2 inhibitor by Nie et al . in @card@ [ @card@ ] . a co-crystal structure of CK2 with a pyrazolo-triazine , herein refer to as PT1 ( synthesis outline in Scheme 5 ) , indicate that the adenine bind site of CK2 be occupy by the pyrazolo-triazine core and the inhibitor be secure in the ATP-binding site by two hydrogen bond in the hinge region of the protein [ @card@ ] . Structure-activity relationship study on PT1 lead to the development of three lead compound , differ in the substituent on one of the phenyl ring , namely methyl piperidine ( PT2 ) , a pyrrolidinyl amide ( PT3 ) and N , N-diethylamide ( PT4 ) . all three compound have nanomolar Ki’s for CK2 but be only micromolar inhibitor of cell growth in both HCT116 and PC3 cell line when test in an MTT assay ( Table 3 ) indicate that the physicochemical property of the series require improvement to diminish this discrepancy [ @card@ ] . subsequent optimisation of the series lead to the development of a second generation of pyrazolo-triazine inhibitor , include PT5 ( Table 3 ) [ @card@ ] . the planarity of the original compound be decrease by macrocylisation with an alkyl side chain . this reduction in flatness appear to successfully aid the compound’s cellular permeability and , despite a 10-fold reduce Ki compare to the previously develop compound , PT5 display comparable growth inhibition of cell ( Table 3 ) . thus , the drop-off in activity between enzymatic and cellular assay be reduce [ @card@ ] . optimisation of the second generation’s bind affinity may lead to the development of potent and cell permeable CK2 inhibitor . however , to date , no such optimisation of constrained pyrazolo-triazines have be publish . additionally , no datum be currently available on the selectivity profile of the compound . a similar class of compound , pyrazolo-pyrimidines , be identify by Dowling et al . use a kinase-focused subset screening approach follow by structure-activity relationship study and crystallography to guide further development [ @card@ ] . this optimisation ultimately lead to the identification of a lead candidate , 7h ( herein refer to as AZ-7h ) ( Figure 6 ) , which have picomolar bind to CK2 ( Kd = @card@ pm ) and nanomolar activity in cell ( GI50 = @card@ nM , HCT116 cell ) [ @card@ ] . unfortunately , datum for direct comparison with the pyrazolo-triazine series be not available . however , the compound’s selectivity be test against a panel of @card@ kinase and AZ-7h show modest selectivity , with @card@ kinase be inhibit by >50 % , all of which be member of the CMGC family . although display limited off-target activity , AZ-7h be active in the 10–20 nM range against Dapk2 and Dapk3 [ @card@ ] . in vivo mouse study show poor oral bioavailability of AZ-7h , but therapeutic compound concentration be achieve with intravenous and intraperitoneal injection , and the compound exhibit dose-dependent tumour growth inhibition [ @card@ ] . the promising result of AZ-7h suggest that further optimisation of the pyrazolo-pyrimidine inhibitor should be strongly consider , with a focus on decrease the activity against Dapk2 and Dapk3 . CX-4945 ( also know as Silmitasertib , ClinicalTrials . Gov identifier : NCT02128282 ( access on @card@ June @card@ ) ) be develop as an orally bioavailable CK2 inhibitor in @card@ by Siddiqui-Jain et al . [ @card@ ] . its synthesis be detail in a patent by Cylene Pharmaceuticals Inc and be a 5-step route start from 3-bromoisonicotinic acid ( Scheme 6 ) [ @card@ ] . CX-4945 be a potent CK2 inhibitor ( IC50 = 1 nM , Ki = @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] and it be postulate that its strong binding affinity arise from the formation of an ionic bridge with Lys68 , in addition to hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond with the hinge region of the active site [ @card@ ] . the selectivity of CX-4945 be test against a panel of @card@ protein kinase , at a concentration 500-times great than its IC50 against CK2 , and seven kinase be find to be inhibit by over @card@ % [ @card@ ] . however , despite the observed selectivity at relatively low concentration , CX-4945 have actually be find to inhibit @card@ other kinase with nanomolar activity , include CLK2 which be inhibit more strongly than CK2α under the same condition [ @card@ ] . due to its high potency and favourable physicochemical property , CX-4945 have be use extensively as a CK2 inhibitor , despite still not display the desire selectivity [ @card@ ] . unlike AZ-7h , CX-4945 be find to be orally bioavailable ( range from 20–51 % across specie ) , represent a great advance in the field [ @card@ ] . CX-4945 have also be see to supress DNA damage repair-related element when complexed with cisplatin-like construct as a prodrug . the CX-4945-Pt(IV ) prodrugs , CX-4945-cisplatin-Cl and CX-4945-DN604-Cl , have superior cytotoxicity to both cisplatin and the improve cisplatin-analogue DN604 and they be able to reverse drug resistance [ @card@ ] . as a result of this promising behaviour , CX-4945 be currently in phase II clinical trial for the treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine [ @card@ ] . a structure-activity relationship study on CX-4945 lead to the development of CX-5011 and CX-5279 ( Figure 7 ) which both contain a pyrimidine ring in place of the pyridine of CX-4945 [ @card@ ] . most promisingly , both compound show a much great specificity than CX-4945 , with Gini coefficient of @card@ , @card@ and @card@ for CX-5011 , CX-5279 and CX-4945 , respectively ( panel of @card@ kinase ) ; the improve Gini coefficient represent the low activity of the compound against other protein kinase . for example , the strong inhibition of CX-4945 for PIM1 ( IC50 = @card@ nM ) be less mark for the two follow-up compound ( PIM1 IC50 = @card@ μM and @card@ μM for CX-5011 and CX-5279 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . despite these more selective derivative be identify , CX-4945 be still often see as the gold standard of CK2 inhibitor due to its high activity and promising preliminary result in clinical trial . nevertheless , its suboptimal selectivity be undesirable when a chemical probe for CK2 be need . due to the promiscuity associate with the aforementioned inhibitor , there be a number of effort ongoing to identify new series of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor . some , such as a new series of 1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indenes ( Figure 8 ) , represent novel scaffold with moderate affinity for CK2 ( micromolar IC50′s ) and present the opportunity for optimisation to develop more potent and selective derivative [ @card@ ] . other report nanomolar IC50′s in enzymatic assay , such as the 2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3-ones series of nanomolar inhibitor ( Figure 8 ) , but be yet to provide information on their selectivity , although this work be ongoing [ @card@ ] . a series of 2-aminothiazole derivative ( Figure 8 ) with submicromolar potency be originally think to be allosteric inhibitor of CK2 but be recently show by Brear et al . to actually bind in the ATP active site [ @card@ ] . of all the recently identify inhibitor , three show the most promising result : GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and SRPIN803-rev derivative ( Figure 8 ) [ @card@ ] . Oshima et al . identify GO289 in @card@ through affinity-based target deconvolution . it be synthesise in four step ( Scheme 7 ) ; three step to install the triazole ring flow by condensation of the hydrazine and a benzylic aldehyde [ @card@ ] . a structure-activity relationship study on GO289 find that the bromoguaiacol group be essential for activity whereas the para position of the substitute phenyl ring be modifiable [ @card@ ] . GO289 be show to have very good activity ( IC50 = 7 nM ) as well as high selectivity for CK2 ; the second most inhibit protein , PIM2 , be much more weakly inhibit by GO289 than CK2 ( PIM2 IC50 = @card@ μM ) . most interestingly , the X-ray crystal structure of GO289 in complex with CK2α indicate key interaction between the compound and residue which be specific to CK2 ( V66 , V116 , H160 , M163 ) , and no interaction with the highly conserve hinge region ( Figure 9 ) [ @card@ ] . most CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor , such as CX-4945 , engage with the hinge region of the protein and these interaction can compensate for the loss of hydrophobic contact between inhibitor and other protein with a V66A mutation ( e. g. , DYRK , HIPK , Pim and CLK family kinase ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , Wells et al . publish a structure-activity relationship study on a series of pyrazolo-pyrimidines base upon AZ-7h , which be discuss earlier [ @card@ ] . the lead compound develop , SGC-CK2-1 ( previously compound @card@ ) , be synthesise via acylation of the aniline follow by reduction of the nitro group and coupling with the pyrazolo-pyrimidine core ( Scheme 8 ) [ @card@ ] . SGC-CK2-1 show strong inhibition of both CK2 catalytic subunits in an intracellular nanoBRET assay on HEK-293 cell ; IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CK2α and CK2α ' , respectively while CX-4945 , for comparison , have an IC50 of @card@ nM ( CK2α ' ) in this assay . promisingly , SGC-CK2-1 exhibit much high selectivity for CK2 than CX-4945 when test against a panel of @card@ kinase ; SGC-CK2-1 inhibit three kinase > @card@ % at 1 μM ( 2 of which be CK2α and CK2α ' ) while CX-4945 inhibit @card@ kinase under the same condition [ @card@ ] . curiously , when test in both HCT-116 and U-87 MG cell in-house , SGC-CK2-1 show no antiproliferative activity ( as do also CX-4945 , unexpectedly ) while show @card@ μM and @card@ μM IC50′s for the same cell line in a @card@ cancer cell line panel . additionally , no caspase @card@ activation be observe with SGC-CK2-1 ( test up to @card@ μM ) . the author suggest that these result imply that antiproliferative activity exhibit by less selective CK2 inhibitor arise due to inhibition of off-target kinase as oppose to CK2 inhibition . as CX-4945 also show no antiproliferative activity in their cellular assay and the externally run cell panel assay result be contradictory to this , these result must be investigate further before reliable conclusion can be draw [ @card@ ] . SRPIN803 be previously identify as a dual inhibitor of SRPK1 and CK2 , although it show 10-fold great inhibition of CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ μM for CK2 and SRPK1 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the crystal structure of SRPIN803 in complex with CK2α reveal that the compound be in the open form ( the thiadiazole nitrogen have not react with the nitrile carbon as report previously ) [ @card@ ] . this lead to the rename of the open form of the compound as SRPIN803-rev for clarity . a series of derivative be subsequently synthesise ( synthetic route for lead compound be show in Scheme 9 ) and find to have moderate inhibitory activity against CK2 ( IC50 = @card@ μM for lead compound ) as well as good selectivity ( only CK2α inhibit over @card@ % at 1 μM in a 320-kinase panel ) and cellular activity ( DC50 = @card@ μM , Jurkat cell ) . these compound constitute the first CK2 inhibitor report to protrude from the active site of the protein on the top of the hinge region ( Figure @card@ ) , and it be this property which be believe to aid their selectivity [ @card@ ] . CK2 have a flexible hinge/αD region which be capable of assume a large number of conformation , the most common two in apo structure be : a closed form , which be see in the majority of protein kinase [ @card@ ] , and an open form which be very rare [ @card@ ] . the author claim that the SRPIN803-rev derivative bind to the open conformation of the hinge/αD region and that it be this binding mode which provide the superior selectivity of the series compare to the majority of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor [ @card@ ] . GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and the SRPIN803-rev derivative be the most active and selective newly identify CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor with the most complete characterisation of their binding mode and selectivity . however , all the newly identify series and scaffold represent an opportunity for the development of potent and selective chemical probe with further optimisation . it be interesting to note that half of the newly identify scaffold contain α , β-unsaturated carbonyl ( Figure 8 ) and as such may be capable of react with a variety of thiol in vivo ; thorough investigation of this reactivity should be consider before further development of these series . nevertheless , the number of newly develop series , as well as the recent success of GO289 , SGC-CK2-1 and the SRPIN803-rev derivative , give hope that a highly selective chemical probe for CK2 will be obtainable with an ATP-competitive inhibitor in the near future . an alternative approach to the problem of ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor be take by Cozza et al . whereby they utilise the promiscuity of TBI towards other enzyme , specifically PIM1 . the promiscuous activity of TBI be curtail by functionalisation of the benzimidazole core with a deoxyribose moiety to form 1-(β-D-2′-deoxyribofuranosyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( TDB ) ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . unlike TBI , TDB be mostly selective for CK2 and PIM1 ( IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CK2 and PIM1 , respectively ) , although it do also inhibit CLK2 comparably ( IC50= @card@ nM ) [ @card@ ] . cell testing show that the pro-apoptotic activity of TDB be superior to “ selective ” inhibitor of either CK2 or PIM1 , which the author suggest be due to the synergistic effect of simultaneous inhibition of CK2 and PIM1 . despite CX-4945 have a great in vitro potency against CK2 than TDB and similar activity against PIM1 ( CK2 IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CX-4945 and TDB , respectively ; PIM1 IC50 = @card@ nM and @card@ nM for CX-4945 and TDB , respectively ) , TDB be find to be more cytotoxic than CX-4945 [ @card@ ] . Chojnacki et al . also publish research in @card@ detail an analogous series of aminoalkyl CK2/PIM1 dual inhibitor base on the structure of TBI ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . however , these compound do not have as favourable binding affinity for CK2α as those aforementioned ; TDB Ki = @card@ nM , @card@ nM ( CK2α and PIM1 , respectively ) whereas for the lead aminoalkyl-substituted derivative , Ki = @card@ nM , @card@ nM ( CK2α and PIM1 , respectively ) [ @card@ ] . recently , a similar approach be take by the Ramos group , this time combine CK2 and HDAC inhibition [ @card@ ] . they combine the structure of vorinostat , a know selective HDAC inhibitor , with that of DMAT to create a series of dual CK2/HDAC inhibitor [ @card@ ] . optimisation lead to the development of a series of compound with low micromolar activity in enzymatic assay as well as low micromolar LC50 value for a variety of cell line ( Figure @card@ ) [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the same group publish an alternative series of CK2/HDAC inhibitor in which the DMAT-derived portion of the compound be replace with the much more potent CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 . the lead compound develop , 15c ( Figure @card@ ) , exhibit significantly great inhibitory activity against CK2 and HDAC1 than the reference compound ( @card@ and @card@ time high activity than CX-4945 and vorinostat , respectively ) as well as micromolar activity in cell-based cytotoxicity assay [ @card@ ] . the development of dual functional inhibitor be still in its infancy . nevertheless , promise early result suggest that it may be a viable strategy to utilise the promiscuity of CK2 ATP-competitive inhibitor for maximum therapeutic effect . this approach may result in the development of highly effective anti-proliferative compound with minimal off-target effect if the promiscuous activity of the inhibitor can be limit to the desire kinase ; however , this strategy be not widely applicable for the development of chemical probe as the observed effect of the compound will depend upon the combined function of the kinase target . another method for CK2 inhibition combine both ATP- and substrate-competitive inhibitor to give bi-substrate inhibitor . Bi-substrate inhibitor be make up of two distinct moiety : typically , an ATP-site inhibit fragment for protein kinase and a motif resemble a substrate of the enzyme [ @card@ ] . these inhibitor be discuss in detail in a recent review of non-ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor and reader be redirect here for a detailed discussion [ @card@ ] . for interest , a brief overview will be provide . the first bi-substrate inhibitor successfully develop be ARC-1502 ( Figure @card@ ) , constitute the ATP-competitive inhibitor TBI bind to an acidic peptide [ @card@ ] . ARC-1502 , have a strong binding affinity for CK2α ( Ki = @card@ nM ) alongside good selectivity [ @card@ ] . however , it be not proteolytically stable or cell permeable , limit its utility [ @card@ ] . subsequently , a cell permeable and stable “ pro-drug ” be develop by use of a peptoid chain and mask of the aspartic acid side chain with acetoxymethyl ester to give ARC-1859 ( Figure @card@ ) , which be show to be active in cell [ @card@ ] . in @card@ , the bi-substrate inhibitor ARC-1513-5O ( Figure @card@ ) be develop which use CX-4945 as the ATP-competitive inhibitor . despite show picomolar bind to CK2 , ARC-1513-5O show only moderate selectivity , highlight the need to use a selective ATP-site inhibit portion of the molecule to gain a selective bi-substrate inhibitor [ @card@ ] . Pietsch et al . recently develop ARC-3140 ( Figure @card@ ) which utilise tetraiodobenzimidazole as the ATP-site inhibitor . ARC-3140 have picomolar bind to CK2 but be show to also bind at two other location on CK2α [ @card@ ] . the handful of bi-substrate inhibitor develop thus far be proof that the strategy be possible . however , the compound need further development and analysis before they can be truly effective chemical probe . in particular , the selectivity profile of the compound need to be evaluate in detail . it be probable that the selectivity of the molecule will be determine by the most potent portion of the molecule . therefore , for this strategy to produce highly selective compound , the selectivity of ATP-competitive inhibitor must be enhance , or the affinity of substrate-competitive inhibitor must be increase . additionally , none of the crystal structure report to date have well define density arise from the substrate bind site portion of the molecule [ @card@ ] . overcome this issue and obtain a well-defined crystal structure for such compound would aid future development and facilitate structure-guided design . an allosteric inhibitor develop by the Hyvönen and Spring group be find to bind in the recently discover αD pocket of CK2 with a Kd of @card@ μM but no inhibition of CK2 be observe [ @card@ ] . due to the proximity of the αD pocket to the ATP-site , the compound be link to a fragment that bind weakly to the ATP-site with the rationale that selectivity for CK2 could be achieve as the majority of the binding affinity of the compound would arise from the allosteric portion of the molecule which bind in the poorly conserve αD pocket . the result compound , CAM4066 , synthesize as outline in Figure @card@ , show subnanomolar activity in enzymatic assay and low micromolar cellular activity ( Kd = @card@ nM , IC50 = @card@ nM , and a GI50 of @card@ μM ( for the methyl-ester prodrug ) ) [ @card@ ] . most promisingly , CAM4066 be show to be selective with a Gini coefficient of @card@ ( @card@ kinase panel , 2 μM CAM4066 ) [ @card@ ] . the high selectivity combine with the promising biological result of CAM4066 suggest that the unique binding mode of the molecule ( Figure @card@ ) be an effective strategy to obtain both strong inhibition of activity and selectivity amongst the kinome when develop protein kinase inhibitor and , thus , it may represent a promising design strategy to be apply to other kinase . despite their diverse and numerous role in biology , protein kinase be a tight-knit family of enzyme . this pose numerous challenge for scientist try to modulate their activity to decipher their specific role and interaction , and for pharmaceutical development . ATP-competitive inhibitor be one of the most explore set of compound via which to modulate their activity yet , due to the highly conserve nature of the ATP-active site amongst the kinome , they be often plague by poor selectivity and off-target effect . this be true for the protein kinase CK2 , for which a truly selective , highly potent and cell permeable ATP-competitive inhibitor be yet to be develop . however , continued research in the field , optimisation of exist inhibitor and the identification of novel scaffold and series of compound be provide hope that a good chemical probe will be obtain in the near future . additionally , three alternative strategy be be use to try and circumvent the issue typically observe with ATP-competitive inhibitor : dual functional inhibitor , bi-substrate inhibitor and the combination of allosteric and ATP-site inhibitor . although the field be in their infancy , all three show encourage initial result and , as such , may represent promising strategy to be apply to the modulation of a variety of other protein kinase . in this review , we have describe the challenge associate with develop ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitor , utilise the kinase CK2 as an example ; downfall of historical CK2 inhibitor be highlight , alongside an overview of the new discovery in the field over the past eight year , include alternative strategy for inhibition utilise the ATP active site . although a fully selective ATP-competitive probe for CK2 have yet to be identify , recent advance in the field put the end in sight , and it be hope that the pitfall and success observe for CK2 inhibitor may provide inspiration for the development of effective modulator of other protein kinase for application in biochemistry , chemical biology and drug development .   prescription of glucose-lowering therapy and risk of COVID-19 mortality in people with type 2 diabetes : a nationwide observational study in England among the risk factor for COVID-19 mortality , type 2 diabetes have emerge as one of the most important and common.1 in a recent population-based cohort study , the risk of COVID-19 mortality be twice as high in people with type 2 diabetes as in those without ; 2 study have also show an association between hyperglycaemia and increase COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes.3 , 4 although potential direct therapeutic benefit in relation to COVID-19 have be propose , the safety of some glucose-lowering therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 have be questioned.1 the DPP-4 inhibitor have be hypothesise to potentially modify the biological activity of various substrate involve in the immune response to the infection , with suggestion of potential benefit or harm.1 , 5 it have be propose that the SGLT2 inhibitor could increase COVID-19-related risk via increase kidney expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2),6 a receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.7 similarly , GLP-1 receptor agonist have be associate with increase ACE2 expression in lung and heart tissue and with beneficial effect in acute lung injury , with suggestion of possible helpful and harmful effect in COVID-19.8 , 9 Recent study have suggest a low risk of COVID-19-related hospital mortality in people with type 2 diabetes who be prescribe metformin before hospital admission10 or sitagliptin on admission.11 Notwithstanding call for ongoing scrutiny to understand the use , risk , and benefit of individual class of glucose-lowering drug in people with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 , there be no comprehensive , comparative datum on differential effect of glucose-lowering drug on risk for severe COVID-19.5 Expert group have make consensus recommendation for glucose-lowering drug , such as to avoid metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor , because of putative risk of lactic acidosis with metformin and diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitor in patient admit to hospital with COVID-19.12 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ however , withdraw these medication could not only result in hyperglycaemia , a risk factor for poor outcome in COVID-19,3 but also increase the long-term risk of major cardiovascular event and progression of chronic kidney disease.19 Research in context evidence before this study from March 1 to Nov @card@ , @card@ , we do weekly search of PubMed and medRxiv use the search term “ COVID-19 ” , “ SARS-CoV-2 ” , “ coronavirus ” , “ SARS virus ” , and “ diabetes ” , restrict to English-language publication . small retrospective study from the USA , China , and France have all report a low or neutral risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people previously or currently prescribe metformin . a recent meta-analysis of five observational study show that the use of metformin before hospital admission in people with diabetes and sepsis ( non-COVID-19 relate ) be associate with low mortality . in a small French multicentre observational study , investigator report no association between use of sulfonylureas , meglitinides , DPP-4 inhibitor , or GLP-1 receptor agonist and COVID-19-related mortality , but high mortality associate with insulin therapy . most previous study be do at a single centre with a small number of people with type 2 diabetes , and most study investigate a small number of glucose-lowering drug . added value of this study To our knowledge , this be the large COVID-19-related population study , cover almost the entire population of people with type 2 diabetes in England . we assess the association of prescription for the follow glucose-lowering drug or drug class with COVID-related mortality : DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 receptor agonist , insulin , meglitinides , metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , sulfonylureas , thiazolidinediones , and α-glucosidase inhibitor . people with type 2 diabetes prescribed metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , and sulfonylureas have a low risk of COVID-19-related mortality and those prescribed insulin and DPP-4 inhibitor have a high risk of COVID-19 related mortality ( compare with those not prescribe these drug ) , although these finding be likely to be due to confound by indication , in view of the\n",
            "use of different drug class in the early and late stage of the type 2 diabetes disease trajectory . implication of all the available evidence our result suggest that there be no evidence to change prescribe of glucose-lowering drug in people with type 2 diabetes in clinical practice in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . in view of the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide , its high prevalence in people with COVID-19 , and the heighten of COVID-19 mortality risk by hyperglycaemia , investigate the safety of glucose-lowering drug be important for people with diabetes , clinician , and policy maker . we therefore investigate the relation between the prescription of commonly use glucose-lowering drug and COVID-19 mortality in a national cohort of people with type 2 diabetes . in particular , we aim to identify any unexpected large effect size that might have potential for recommendation about routinely use glucose-lowering drug in clinical practice . this be a nationwide observational cohort study do with datum from England . the study be do in line with the RECORD-PE guideline for conduct and report a pharmacoepidemiological study with routinely collect datum ( appendix pp 7–9 ) . the National Diabetes Audit ( NDA ) have collate datum on people with diagnose diabetes register with a health-care provider in England since @card@ these data be link via unique National Health Service ( NHS ) number to hospital episode statistic , a record of all hospital admission in England ; and to civil death registration , collate by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) . information on data approval and permission be in the appendix ( pp 1–2 ) . the study population consist of individual with type 2 diabetes include in the NDA data extraction from Jan 1 , @card@ , to March @card@ , @card@ , whose most recent general practice be in England and provide datum on prescription to the NDA , and who be alive on Feb @card@ , @card@ ( index date ) . people with an unknown date of birth or recorded date of birth give an age of @card@ year or old be exclude from the analysis . diabetes be diagnose in routine clinical care and type 2 diabetes be deduce from the clinical code record in electronic patient record and collate by the NDA . where there be code for multiple type of diabetes , the type identify by a specialist diabetes service be give precedence over that define in primary care ; where there be a discrepancy between code use in specialist service or within primary care , the late recorded type of diabetes be assume to be the most accurate . the primary exposure of interest in this analysis be prescription for the follow glucose-lowering drug or drug class : DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 receptor agonist , insulin , meglitinides , metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , sulfonylureas , thiazolidinediones , and α-glucosidase inhibitor . individual be class as be prescribe the drug or drug class if they have receive two or more prescription between July 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ . death register with on that occur between Feb @card@ , @card@ , and Aug @card@ , @card@ , be include in the analysis . death be define as COVID-19 relate if the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ; version @card@ ) code U07.1 ( COVID-19 , virus identify ) or U07.2 ( COVID-19 , virus not identify ) be record as either the primary underlie or secondary cause of death . age and duration of diagnose diabetes be calculate for the index date of Feb @card@ , @card@ . home postcode be use to identify region of residence and social deprivation status , as define by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation @card@ ethnicity be obtain from record of self-reported ethnic group during the course of routine clinical care . the most recent measurement of HbA1c , systolic blood pressure , total serum cholesterol , and creatinine record between Jan 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ , be identify . the modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula be use to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . people who have receive one or more prescription for antihypertensive drug or statins between Jan 1 , @card@ , and Dec @card@ , @card@ , be identify from general practice prescribe record .

To our knowledge , this be the large study to examine the association of several commonly prescribe class of glucose-lowering drug with COVID-19-related mortality . in this nationally representative , population-based study of 2·85 million people with type 2 diabetes , there be statistical evidence that people prescribe metformin , SGLT2 inhibitor , and sulfonylureas have a low mortality risk than those not prescribe these drug . conversely , the risk be high in those prescribed insulin and DPP-4 inhibitor than those not prescribe these drug . these finding be likely to be relate in part to confound by indication , because metformin be use early in the disease trajectory of type 2 diabetes whereas insulin be typically initiate later . furthermore , the absolute increase and decrease in risk be very small . national recommendation for use of DPP-4 inhibitor include old people and particularly those with frailty.26 The observe low risk in people prescribe SGLT2 inhibitor and sulfonylureas be likely to be relate to confound by indication and their low use in old people , particularly those with frailty , in view of increase risk of volume depletion for SGLT2 inhibitor and hypoglycaemia for sulfonylureas . NDA datum do not include information on frailty ; we be therefore unable to adjust for this variable . in exploratory subgroup analysis , we identify some difference by age and history of cardiovascular disease , although these result should be interpret with caution in view of a low statistical power and residual confounding.27 the low risk of mortality in patient who be prescribe metformin and the high risk in those prescribed insulin , have be observe previously and might be relate to residual confound by the burden of cardiorenal comorbidities and historical glycaemic burden , factor that can be fully address by statistical adjustments.10 association between insulin prescription and mortality have also be report in previous observational study and be relate to commencement of insulin at a late stage of the disease.28 , @card@ Smaller retrospective study from the USA , China , and France have all report a low or neutral risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people previously or currently prescribe metformin.10 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ in a meta-analysis of five observational study include @card@ patient , use of metformin before hospital admission in people with diabetes and sepsis ( non-COVID-19 relate ) be associate with low mortality.33 in a French multicentre observational study that include @card@ people with type 2 diabetes , investigator report no association between use of sulfonylureas , meglitinides , DPP-4 inhibitor , or GLP-1 receptor agonist and COVID-19-related mortality ; however , there be high mortality associate with insulin therapy ( odd ratio 1·71 [ @card@ % CI 1·20–2·43]).10 in one small observational study in Northern Italy of @card@ patient with type 2 diabetes who be admit to hospital with COVID-19 , a low risk of mortality be see in patient on sitagliptin than in those who receive standard of care ( HR 0·44 [ @card@ % CI 0·29–0·66]).11 although some of these finding be confirm in our analysis , we also observe several difference probably relate to dissimilarity in sample size or confound adjustment . our study have several limitation . because the medication include be prescribe in the last 6 month of @card@ , there be the possibility that some of these agent have be suspend before or on admission to hospital for COVID-19 . there be no measure of medication adherence in this study ; however , a previous report of overall adherence for most glucose-lowering therapy use an objective measure ( urine liquid chromatography ) show adherence rate for glucose-lowering medication of about @card@ moreover , the NDA do not collect datum on the dose of medication . in our analysis , we adjust for several important potential confounder , include regional difference , to reduce the risk of confound ; however , we can exclude residual confound due to imperfect adjustment for those factor we have consider , nor unmeasured confound by factor that we have not include . furthermore , during the pandemic , the reporting of COVID-19 as either the underlie cause of death or a significant contributory factor might have be inconsistent ; although it be difficult to quantify the extent or direction of any bias create by the omission of death possibly relate to COVID-19 , it be unlikely that this bias would be differential with respect to class of glucose-lowering therapy . we report association for the prescription of all class of glucose-lowering medication in people with type 2 diabetes in England ; the number of event be low for meglitinides and α-glucosidase inhibitor because these drug be not widely use in England , although they be use more extensively in some other country . give the many possible combination of glucose-lowering drug class that can be use by patient with type 2 diabetes , it be not possible to estimate the HRs for these combination ; however , this be not the main purpose of the analysis . we use the missing-category approach to maximise the size of the cohort and the statistical power ; although other approach could be apply to account for miss datum , their relative strength and limitation in the context of doubly robust adjustment with the use of propensity score as a variable be uncertain . a strength of our study be the whole-population inclusion of nearly all people diagnose with type 2 diabetes in England , include comprehensive prepandemic information on risk factor ; the result be therefore probably generalisable to the general population of people with type 2 diabetes . a further strength be the comprehensive assessment of the risk across all class of glucose-lowering drug commonly use in clinical practice—previous study be largely limit to single drug . because of provision of universal health care , with all medicine for people with diabetes available without charge in England , our result should not be bias by access to medication . many study of the risk of therapy in patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 have focus on people in hospital,10 whereas our cohort include all people with type 2 diabetes , whether or not they be admit to hospital with COVID-19 . furthermore , our outcome of all death with COVID-19 identify as a cause , in-hospital or outside of hospital , provide a robust outcome independent of clinical decision , administrative arrangement , and resource availability , which might influence decision relate to hospital or intensive care unit admission . give the nature of this study , we can infer causality from our observation . randomise clinical trial assess the role of glucose-lowering therapy would be necessary to assess any causal effect of glucose-lowering drug on COVID-19 outcome in patient with type 2 diabetes . the DARE-19 study ( NCT04350593 ) be investigate the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus placebo on the risk of death or organ dysfunction in patient admit to hospital with COVID-19 . in the MET-COVID trial ( NCT04510194 ) , the effect of metformin be be compare with placebo for both the prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection and the risk of COVID-19 disease . because neither of these study be specifically include patient with type 2 diabetes , their result will generate little evidence on the safety of these glucose-lowering drug in this patient population . however , several study with DPP-4 inhibitor ( NCT04365517 , NCT04371978 , and NCT04341935 ) be be conduct in patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 . in summary , in this study of a national cohort of 2·85 million people with type 2 diabetes , we identify a statistically low risk of COVID-19-related mortality in patient prescribe metformin and a high risk of COVID-19-related mortality in patient prescribe insulin , support finding from previous small study . we also identify a low risk with sulfonylureas and SGLT2 inhibitor and a slightly high risk with DPP-4 inhibitor . the low and high risk associate with these drug be likely to be due to residual confound rather than direct drug effect . Cardiorenal comorbidities and frailty be probable contributor to our observation and be also important COVID-19 risk factor . we interpret these finding to suggest that there be , as yet , no clear indication to jeopardise a modifiable risk factor—glucose control—or other potential glucose-independent benefit of specific drug by stop or change diabetes medication in people with type 2 diabetes in daily practice . additional study to validate these finding in large national datasets in other country be warrant . datum from the NDA can be request through the NHS Digital Data Access Request Service process . for further information , contact diabetes@nhs . net .

330×109/L；骨髓象：骨髓增生极度活跃，幼稚淋巴细胞占0.635；免疫分型示异常细胞约占有核细胞的53.5%，主要表达CD2、CD3（dim）、CD5、CD7、CD58、cCD3、TdT。常见白血病融合基因及预后相关基因筛查阴性。染色体核型：46 , XY。诊断为ALL（T系，中危）。按照《儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病诊疗建议（第四次修订）》[2]方案化疗。第8天外周血幼稚细胞6.81×109/L（>1×109/L），提示泼尼松诱导反应欠佳，故升级为高危组化疗方案。第15天骨髓幼稚细胞9.5%（部分缓解），第33天评估骨髓残留白血病细胞<10−4，提示达到完全缓解。后按序化疗至2019年8月进入维持治疗，期间复查骨髓细胞学提示完全缓解，骨髓MRD阴性。2020年1月19日患儿按计划接受高危组维持阶段化疗（环磷酰胺300 mg·m−2·d−1+阿糖胞苷300 mg·m−2·d−1）。结束化疗6 d后血常规：WBC 0.75×109/L、ANC 0.35×109/L、淋巴细胞计数绝对值（ALC）0.18×109/L、HGB @card@ g/L、PLT 14×109/L，输注浓缩红细胞及单采血小板支持治疗，当时无发热及咳嗽等不适。1月27日患儿开始发热，体温37.8 °C，同时伴有阵发性咳嗽。查体可见咽充血，双侧扁桃体Ⅰ度肿大，肺部听诊无特殊。复查血常规：WBC 0.5×109/L、ANC 0.05×109/L、ALC 0.19×109/L、HGB @card@ g/L、PLT 10×109/L，超敏C反应蛋白6.48 mg/L。予头孢哌酮/舒巴坦+万古霉素抗感染治疗3 d，每天仍频繁发热（最高38.6 °C），无明显寒战畏寒，间断阵发性干咳。1月31日肺部CT示右肺中叶肺炎，左肺下叶肺炎部分实变，右肺局部胸膜增厚（图1A）。考虑抗感染效果不佳，升级为美罗培南+利奈唑胺。复查超敏C反应蛋白3.43 mg/L。G试验<50 ng/L（正常参考值：<100 ng/L）。肺炎支原体抗体、结核感染T细胞斑点试验（T-spot试验）及多次血培养结果均为阴性。细胞因子：IL-6 @card@

mmHg=0.133 kPa），动脉氧分压（PO2）61 mmHg（正常参考值：80~100 mmHg），氧饱和度（SaO2）92%（正常参考值：95%~98%），碱剩余（BE）1 mmol/L（正常参考值：−3.0~3.0 mmol/L），HCO3− @card@ mmol/L（正常参考值：22~27 mmol/L）。2月1日加用卡泊芬净抢先抗真菌治疗，并辅助丙种球蛋白（0.4 g·kg−1·d−1×5 d）支持治疗。加做呼吸道病毒七项、G/GM试验、T-spot试验及多次血培养检查。2月2日呼吸道病毒七项结果回报提示甲型流感病毒阳性，立即加用奥司他韦口服。患儿每天仍有2~3次发热，热峰可达39.0 °C，同时伴有寒战，药物退热后可降至正常体温，偶有干咳。发热病程第10天（2020年2月5日）肺部CT示：双肺片状絮状密度增高影，夹杂周围磨玻璃影改变，肺炎并局部实变，较前明显进展，双侧少量胸腔积液（图1B）。予心电监护，持续经皮血氧饱和度监测，波动于96%~99%。结合影像学特征和近期武汉地区暴发流行的新型病毒感染疫情，2月7日行2019-nCoV核酸检测，结果回报2019-nCoV核酸检测阳性，立即转往隔离病房。加用利巴韦林静脉输注（每次5 mg/kg，每日2次）+重组干扰素α-1b雾化吸入（每次10万U，每日2次）+阿比多尔口服（每次100 mg，每日3次），考虑患儿肺部实变病灶明显伴有胸腔积液，予甲泼尼龙1 mg·kg−1·d−1治疗。2月11日患儿仍有反复发热，伴有阵咳，活动后稍气促，但无呼吸困难表现，此时经皮血氧饱和度较前稍有下降，波动于95%左右。复查2019-nCoV核酸仍为阳性，美罗培南治疗1周，体温无好转趋势，考虑抗感染治疗无效，调整美罗培南为丁胺卡那抗感染。2月13日复查肺部CT提示双肺片状絮状密度增高影及磨玻璃影，小叶间壁增厚，范围较前进展，原双侧胸腔积液已吸收（图1C）。甲泼尼龙加量至3 mg·kg−1·d−1，阿比多尔加量至每次200 mg，每日2次，同时予丙种球蛋白（5 g/d）输注及鼻导管吸氧支持治疗。2月14日复查血常规示WBC 1.24×109/L、ANC 0.62×109/L、HGB @card@ g/L，PLT 119×109/L，超敏C反应蛋白正常，提示骨髓抑制已经处于恢复中；2019-nCoV核酸阴性；发热间隔延长至16~18

3]，对于COVID-19确诊患儿，如果在积极治疗后仍持续发热，可在强力广覆盖抗感染的前提下，适时适量使用激素并联合连续小剂量丙种球蛋白输注支持治疗，以抑制免疫损伤导致继发细胞因子风暴/多脏器器官功能衰竭的发生，遏制病情向危重发展。儿童COVID-19临床表现以发热和咳嗽较为常见，也可有乏力、肌痛、恶心、呕吐或腹泻等。早期肺部CT呈多发小斑片影及间质改变，以肺外带明显，进而发展为双肺多发磨玻璃影或浸润影，严重者可出现肺实变，胸腔积液少见，轻症病例可以无明显病变[4]。而恶性血液病患儿化疗后粒缺合并发热病情复杂，治疗难度大于一般COVID-19患者。本例患儿平时基本居家生活，1月13日乘坐武汉市内公共交通来院化疗，截止到1月19日化疗结束均在病房层流床内。住院期间除陪护家长外，未与其他患儿或家属亲密接触。期间陪护家长也无发热、咳嗽等不适。患儿在接受化疗后10 d出现发热，但其父母以及住院时同病房人群均无COVID-19相关接触史，也无发热、咳嗽等临床症状，COVID-19核酸检测结果均阴性。且患儿的相关实验室检查均未见异常，仅肺部CT提示右中叶肺部实变，我们首先考虑为化疗后粒缺合并发热，并按照相关临床诊疗指南予对应治疗[5]。此后甲型流感病毒检测阳性，但口服奥司他韦并无明显改善，再次复查肺部CT发现肺部病灶进展，并结合目前疫情，加做2019-nCoV核酸检测最终明确诊断。由于该患儿无明确流行病学接触史，我们推测该患儿可能就医途中感染。 本例患儿发热第11天2019-nCoV核酸阳性，但发热第5天肺部CT已可观察到病灶，提示影像学结合病原学检查的重要性。患儿于发热第16天（2月12日）、第18天（2月14日）、第21天（2月17日）2019-nCoV核酸结果分别为阳性、阴性、阳性，提示对于白血病患儿化疗后骨髓抑制期感染2019-nCoV，若临床好转不明显（比如仍有持续发热、咳嗽症状加重等），有必要动态监测核酸以评估2019-nCoV病毒负荷，同时咽拭子核酸检测存在假阴性可能，一次转阴并不能代表病毒得到控制。本例患儿发病至今将近3周时间，2019-nCoV核酸仍未转阴，比邓慧玲等[6]报道的一般患儿转阴时间长，可能是ALL患儿合并COVID-19的特征。此外该例患儿发病初期铁蛋白即异常升高，是否与患儿体温控制不佳，临床疗效不好有关值得关注。 既往SARS冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）感染中，细胞因子风暴是重要的致死原因[7]。陈蕾等[8]分析29例成人COVID-19患者细胞因子水平，危重患者IL-2R与IL-6水平明显升高。而本例患儿的细胞因子水平仅仅IL-6有轻度升高，IL-2始终稳定在正常范围内。因此COVID-19患儿糖皮质激素的使用时机和用量应有别于成人病例。 COVID-19疫情期间避免血液肿瘤疾病患儿发生院内感染[9]，尤其是避免化疗后粒缺患儿的院内感染尤为重要。结合本病例的诊治经验，我们建议：（1）对于已获得完全缓解的白血病儿童，尽可能避免强化疗，可以口服巯嘌呤/甲氨蝶呤维持治疗，以降低感染风险。（2）为避免病区内感染暴发，儿童血液肿瘤病房必须严格落实医院感染管理制度和消毒隔离制度，严格执行预检分诊、有序预约入院化疗并控制陪护家长。对于疑似COVID-19感染的血液肿瘤患儿应立即按照相关防治指南进行分级诊断和分层管理。   Correction to : the Post-Pandemic World : between Constitutionalized and Authoritarian Orders – China’s Narrative-Power Play in the Pandemic Era Correction to : Journal of Chinese Political Science . 10.1007/s11366-020-09695-3 the original version of the article miss to add two reference concern method add to the main text and in the reference list . follow be the change on page 3 of the original version as well as the detail of the two missing reference . the subsequent reference citation be also adjust accordingly in the original version . in term of method , this article will rely on a two-level document analysis of state document , policy speech , newspaper , magazine article and ( social ) medium account [ 8 ] . the first level involve a systematic review of news article , journal and literature on Chinese narrative power and change world order . with insight derive from this review , relate primary document such as official statement , speech , policy proposal , and interview deliver by government/officials/media outlet ( particularly relevant to the COVID-19 crisis ) will be investigate [ 8 ] . besides this , social medium ( Twitter , YouTube , et cetera ) will be use as an auxiliary resource because the pandemic be a current and ongoing issue and the role of social medium in narrative discussion should not be ignored.1 then the second level , the discourse analysis , will be integrate with knowledge derive from the first level to establish the “ interweave link between the text and the…contexts ” ( [ 8 , 9]:1756 ) . the original article have be correct .   a rapid and reliable liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method for SARS-CoV-2 analysis from gargle solution and saliva the COVID-19 pandemic be one of the big challenge of our time . during the past @card@ year , we have see a rapid spread of the disease with increase number of infection and fatality . the number be so dynamic that it be difficult to pencil them in exact count as be they be obsolete within hour . To date , there have be more than @card@ million of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close to 3 million of fatality worldwide [ 1 ] , with ~120 million of infected individual have recover and ~ @card@ million of vaccine dose administered.1 an infection with SARS-CoV-2 do not necessarily lead to serious health problem ; often , the patient do not experience any symptom . this be one of the great challenge when deal with SARS-CoV-2 , make it one of the most contagious and successfully spread virus . therefore , reliable diagnostic tool allow a rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 be of enormous importance . currently , the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic be reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR ) . despite its strength , RT-qPCR also suffer a number of drawback [ 2 ] . at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early @card@ , the big challenge be the availability of high-throughput tool to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection . this have be successfully address by the development of cost-efficient , ready-to-use antigen detection test , which have become broadly available [ 3 ] . another important issue that need to be deal with be the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 mutation that have to be detect in routine diagnostic [ 4 ] . mass spectrometry ( Ms ) have already be spot in April @card@ as a valuable complementary method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic from gargle solution of COVID-19 patient [ 5 ] . in the meantime , the potential of MS have become evident [ 6 ] and numerous report on SARS-CoV-2 identification by MS method have be publish since the beginning of the pandemic [ 7–11 ] . in the present work , we describe our late effort in develop a rapid liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic from gargle solution and saliva . we report an MS-compatible sample preparation strategy and a quantification protocol that be base on selected peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by an LC-multiple-reaction monitoring ( MRM)-MS/MS approach . for LC-MS/MS method development , two sample types—gargle solution and saliva—were employ . gargle solution be collect from six healthy individual by gargle with @card@ mL of isotonic ( @card@ % ( w/v ) ) NaCl solution for @card@ s. Saliva sample be directly collect from three healthy individual by spit ~1 mL of saliva into a 50-mL tube . in initial experiment , our original sample preparation procedure [ 5 ] be employ , add 1 mL of acetone ( −20 °C ) to @card@ μL of gargle solution . after store the sample at −20 °C overnight , sample be centrifuge ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) , and the protein pellet be digest use the Smart Digest ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) protocol with immobilize trypsin bead . in further experiment , we optimize sample preparation in respect to short preparation time , high sensitivity , and improve compatibility with RT-qPCR by use TRIZOL reagent ( @card@ mL of solution contain @card@ g guanidinium thiocyanate , @card@ g ammonium thiocyanate , @card@ mL 3 M sodium acetate , 5 g glycerol , @card@ mL Roti Aqua-Phenol ( Roth ) ) for protein denaturation . a total of @card@ μL of TRIZOL reagent be add to @card@ μL of saliva and the solution be load on centrifugation filter unit ( Amicon , @card@ kDa molecular weight cutoff , Millipore ) . afterwards , the filter unit be treat accord to the follow filter-aided sample preparation ( FASP ) protocol : filter unit be wash twice with @card@ μL of @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate , follow by centrifugation ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) and incubate at @card@ °C for 2 h with trypsin ( Promega ) ( 1 μg in @card@ μL of @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate ) . tryptic peptide be collect by add @card@ μL of @card@ M NaCl , follow by a centrifugation step ( 14,000g , @card@ min ) . after add @card@ μL of @card@ % ( v/v ) trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , sample volume be adjust to @card@ μL , before the sample be subject to LC-MS/MS analysis . Four selected synthetic peptide derive from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein ( Arg41-Lsy61 , Arg41-Lys65 , Met210-Arg226 , and Met210-Lys233 ) and their heavy isotope ( 13C and 15N)-labeled variant ( Arg41-Lsy*61 , Arg41-Lys*65 , Met210-Arg*226 , and Met210-Lys*233 , SpikeTide-TQL peptide , where * denote [ 13C615N4]-Arg or [ 13C615N2]-Lys ) be purchase from JPT Peptide Technologies and use for method development and as quantitation standard . LC separation of peptide be perform on a UPLC I-Class FTN system ( Waters ) equip with a BEH C18 column ( @card@ mm. × @card@ mm. , @card@ μm , Waters ) . the UPLC system be directly couple to a Xevo TQ-XS mass spectrometer ( Waters ) equip with electrospray ionization ( ESI ) source . MS acquisition be perform use an MRM method of two selected transition per peptide with optimize collision energy . Isotope-labeled peptide ( see above ) be dilute in @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate to concentration between 5 amol/μL and @card@ fmol/μL and digest with trypsin . Isotope-labeled peptide be spike at different concentration ( @card@ to @card@ fmol/μL ) to gargle solution sample after tryptic digestion ( Smart digestion protocol ) . alternatively , isotope-labeled peptide be spike at the same concentration ( @card@ to @card@ fmol/μL ) to saliva sample after tryptic digestion ( TRIZOL/FASP protocol ) . the obtain result serve to determine the limit of detection ( Lod ) and the limit of quantitation ( LOQ ) of our LC-MS/MS method . the aim of our LC-MS/MS method development be to obtain highly sensitive detection and accurate quantitation of the tryptic peptide Arg41-Lsy61 , Arg41-Lys65 , Met210-Arg226 , and Met210-Lys233 from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . it have to be note that these peptide exhibit low ionization efficiency compare to other tryptic peptide in the digestion mixture of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . additionally , they be challenge for MS analysis due to their size and charge . we still select these specific SARS-CoV-2 peptide as they be recently show to be generate from authentic material of infected patient [ 5 ] . the two peptide start with Arg41 be specific for a group of coronaviruses , while the two peptide start with Met210 be unique for SARS-CoV-2 . Methionine-containing peptide be not ideally suit for LC-MS/MS quantitation as they might undergo oxidation process . however , we be able to monitor oxidation product with our synthetic peptide standard and observe only <3 % of Met-oxidized variant ( datum not show ) . we therefore feel confident to include the respective Met-containing peptide in our experiment . we seek to achieve the high possible sensitivity , together with short run time in a robust setup that might be use in a clinical routine environment . first , we have to switch from our initial nano-HPLC setup ( @card@ nL/min ) with an LC time of more than 3 h [ 5 ] to a normal-flow UPLC setup . the most important constraint be to achieve a baseline LC separation of the four peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify previously in gargle sample [ 5 ] . for this , we apply the LC gradient as display in Fig . 1 with a total cycle time of 5 min . it should be note that short LC-MS/MS cycle time be crucial for conduct medium- to high-throughput analysis in MS-based SARS-CoV-2 routine diagnostic . while sample preparation can be parallelize enable hundred of sample to be process at the same time , LC-MS/MS sample throughput rely on short cycle time and the number of available mass spectrometer . consequently , LC-MS/MS cycle time of 5 min allow @card@ sample per hour ( @card@ sample per day ) to be analyze on each instrument . another important aspect to be consider for LC-MS/MS analysis in a clinical setting be a low sample carryover from injection to injection . carryover between sample be reduce in our setup to non-detectable amount by use @card@ % ( v/v ) TFA as purge solution and @card@ % ( v/v ) formic acid plus @card@ % ( v/v ) TFA in water/acetonitrile ( @card@ ( v/v ) ) as wash solution of the UPLC system ( datum not show ) . next , we have to move from the high-resolution mass spectrometer ( Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid ) that have be employ in our previous study [ 5 ] to a quadrupole instrument of the high sensitivity . sensitivity be one of the key point for develop MS-based , reliable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic method as viral protein be directly detect . this stand in contrast to RT-qPCR that rely on the amplification of the virus ' genetic material . therefore , the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 be directly relate to the sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS method . the most sensitive method use triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer be MRM scan . MRM be a targeted method that have to be specifically optimize for each analyte by evaluate the optimum condition for collisional activation and thereby identify the most abundant and characteristic fragment ion . as outline above , optimization of our LC-MS/MS method be base on synthetic variant of four peptide derive from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify in our previous study [ 5 ] . for these four peptide , we identify the most suitable MRM transition and collision energy with two transition per peptide ( Table 1 ) . we also add MRM transition of selected tryptic peptide from other abundant protein present in our sample and monitor them during the optimization process for sample preparation ( see below ) . all four synthetic SARS-CoV-2 peptide be employ as heavy isotope ( 13C and 15N)-labeled version ( SpikeTide-TQL peptide ) that be add to the sample solution to allow for an accurate detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 peptide . heavy isotope-labeled peptide only differ in the mass of precursor and fragment ion , but yield identical fragmentation pattern as the non-labeled SARS-CoV-2 peptide upon collisional activation in the MRM approach . also , the chromatographic behavior of non-labeled and label peptide be identical . therefore , MRM chromatogram of the synthetic heavy isotope-labeled peptide can only be use for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in patient sample , but will also exclude the assignment of false positive in highly complex matrix . in further experiment , we then use our established LC-MS/MS method for optimize sample preparation . the peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that have be identify in our previous study [ 5 ] comprise amino acid sequence Arg41-Lys65 and Met210-Lys233 . these peptide contain one miss cleavage site each as our initial digestion procedure be apparently incomplete . the respective SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide without miss cleavage site be compose of amino acid sequence Arg41-Lsy61 and Met210-Arg226 . the optimize sample preparation ( see below ) now allow a complete enzymatic digestion , yield peptide Arg41-Lsy61 and Met210-Arg226 from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein . for that reason , we only employ isotope-labeled SpikeTide-TQL peptide Arg41-Lsy*61 and Met210-Arg*226 in all follow experiment . SpikeTide-TQL peptide be extend by a C-terminal tag for enhanced solubility and photometric quantitation that be remove during tryptic digestion . it be not possible to directly add these peptide to gargle solution or saliva as the peptide do not precipitate and will not be retain use centrifugation filter device with a molecular weight cutoff value of @card@ kDa . therefore , isotope-labeled peptide be add after tryptic digestion in all experiment . Figure 2A display the Lod and LOQ of Arg41-Lsy*61 and Met210-Arg*226 isotope-labeled peptide ( see “ experimental section ” ) that have be digest with trypsin in @card@ mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate without add protein matrix . both Lod and LOQ be determine to be low than @card@ amol/μL . in further experiment , isotope-labeled peptide be spike to protein pellet of gargle solution before the Smart digestion protocol [ 5 ] be apply . Figure 2B display a dramatic decrease in sensitivity and reproducibility for the SARS-CoV-2 peptide upon add a protein matrix , underline the need to optimize sample preparation . improve our sample preparation protocol include sample collection , sample homogeneity , sample concentration , and sample preparation time . in principle , nasopharyngeal swab , gargle solution , and saliva be suit to detect SARS-CoV-2 [ 5 , 11–13 ] . a number of challenge regard non-MS-compatible contamination have be report for swab sample [ @card@ ] , where the sample volume be usually less than @card@ μL . additionally , the quantitative reproducibility of swab sample collection be a matter of debate [ @card@ ] , make gargle solution a true alternative for sample collection instead of the commonly use nasopharyngeal swab sample . Saliva of COVID-19 patient should contain even high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 particle than gargle solution and as saliva be easy to collect , sample quality should be highly reproducible . conclusively , we consider saliva to be the optimum sample for a reproducible and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and focus our sample preparation optimization on saliva sample . Saliva be a complex matrix make sample preparation challenge . also , handle and inactivate presumably infectious saliva sample be an issue that require special attention during method development . first , @card@ μL of saliva be treat with TRIZOL reagent for a complete dissolution of all sample component . TRIZOL reagent be typically use for RNA preparation [ @card@ , @card@ ] and present one of the most potent protein denaturant . it allow a rapid and complete inactivation of RNases , therefore enable the isolation of intact RNA from cell lysates . treat our sample with TRIZOL reagent lead to homogenous solution and be therefore compatible with our FASP protocol for efficient washing and tryptic digestion of protein . the pellet originate from acetone precipitation , as use in our previous study [ 5 ] , be sometimes find to be incompletely dissolve in Smart digest buffer . further advantage of the TRIZOL treatment be the direct availability of the sample as no overnight protein precipitation step be need , and the possibility to split sample for parallel analysis by LC-MS/MS and RT-qPCR . the TRIZOL/FASP protocol be compatible with add the isotope-labeled peptide after tryptic digestion have be perform . strikingly , the observed LOD/LOQ value ( Fig . 2C ) be comparable to value obtain without protein matrix ( Fig . 2A ) . One initial finding when optimize the TRIZOL/FASP protocol be the detection of high amount of cytoskeletal keratin in a number of saliva sample . therefore , we add four specific MRM transition for highly abundant keratin peptide ( Table 1 ) and monitor their detection . apparently , keratin contain in the saliva sample be efficiently remove by a simple centrifugation step before apply the FASP protocol and tryptic digestion . we speculate that without centrifugation , the TRIZOL reagent completely dissolve the keratin-containing cell in the saliva make them accessible for a subsequent tryptic digestion . this additional simple centrifugation step of saliva sample will not interfere with the overall sample preparation procedure . nevertheless , there be a slight chance that virus particle might be attach to cell contain in saliva , which will then be remove by centrifugation . for that reason , we test the influence of keratin on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide . interestingly , neither Lod nor LOQ value be negatively affect by the presence of high amount of keratin peptide in the sample ( Fig . 3 ) . on the other hand , load very low protein amount ( below 1 μg ) on the centrifugation filter device result in a loss of spiked SARS-CoV-2 peptide , which be probably cause by protein and peptide bind to the membrane of the filter unit . a minimum protein load of 1 μg per filter unit be obtain from treat @card@ μL of saliva with TRIZOL . additionally , sample loading might be increase to further improve sensitivity , albeit at the cost of long sample preparation time . it be important to note that neither sample reduction nor alkylation step be perform in our digestion protocol as the respective SARS-CoV-2 peptide do not contain cysteine residue and proteolytic accessibility of these peptide be not restrict by disulfide bond . in conclusion , the overall time for sample preparation can be reduce to less than 3 h and can be perform in a highly parallelize fashion . therefore , the direct use of saliva in combination with our optimize TRIZOL/FASP protocol should improve both sample collection and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection . it have be demonstrate that @card@ genome , i. e. , DNA plasmids [ @card@ ] , can be detect in a volume of @card@ μL with cycle time ( ct ) of @card@ in RT-qPCR experiment . a RT-qPCR detection with a ct value of @card@ would require the presence of @card@ genome equivalent in @card@ μL . calculation with @card@ molecule of nucleoprotein per SARS-CoV-2 virus particle [ @card@ ] result in a nucleoprotein concentration of ~520 amol/μL , correspond to a ct value of @card@ [ @card@ ] . in our experiment , we use @card@ μL of saliva and generate @card@ μL of sample solution for LC-MS/MS analysis . under these condition , the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptide would be @card@ amol/μL , which be above our estimated LOD/LOQ of ~500 amol/μL ( see above ) . it should be note that this reflect the most conservative analytical calculation . it be likely that a “ real-world ” RT-qPCR experiment be less sensitive than the one perform under the ideal condition describe in [ @card@ ] as RNA recovery be rarely complete . therefore , RT-qPCR experiment with specific ct value would be base on high virus number , result in de facto high nucleoprotein concentration . patient sample from our early study [ 5 ] exhibit ct value of @card@ and we be able to detect peptide from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein with a nano-HPLC-nano-ESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS approach . in direct comparison , our previous LC-MS/MS method be find to be less sensitive than the LC-MS/MS approach we describe herein ( datum not show ) . therefore , we be confident to assume that ct value of high than @card@ will easily be obtain with our new LC/MRM-MS method . the sensitivity of our LC/MRM-MS approach be likely to be further improve by use high sample amount , i. e. , @card@ or @card@ μL of saliva , and by enrich the tryptic SARS-CoV-2 peptide during sample preparation . we successfully develop an LC-MS/MS method base on an MRM approach that can be use for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva sample . our approach be complementary to RT-qPCR method and exist antigen test , and can be use in a routine clinical environment where quadrupole mass spectrometer be available . sample preparation time be less than 3 h and sample handling can be parallelize for hundred of sample ( both similar to RT-qPCR ) . LC-MS/MS analysis time of our method be only 5 min , allow selected SARS-CoV-2 peptide to be detect and quantify at concentration as low as @card@ amol/μL . this concentration of SARS-CoV-2 peptide be obtain by digest @card@ μL of saliva from infected patient with RT-qPCR ct value of @card@ . even high ct value will be achieve if SARS-CoV-2 peptide enrichment be enrich by antibody . in general , LC-MS/MS method exhibit an improve quantitation accuracy compare to RT-qPCR as no amplification ( @card@ to @card@ time ) of the analytes be involve . it be still a matter of debate if/how different sample collection protocol influence SARS-CoV-2 detection . MRM-MS-based method could fill this gap and allow deliver more precise and accurate quantitative datum for a direct comparison between different method . the outstanding advantage of LC/MRM method be their potential to detect SARS-CoV2 mutation . the vast majority of amino acid exchange will result in mass shift that be easily detect by Ms , but there will probably be no drastic change in the physicochemical property of the respective SARS-CoV-2 peptide , such as ionization efficiency and fragmentation pattern . virus mutation can be easily monitor by adapt select MRM transition use simple mathematical calculation and by synthesize novel SARS-CoV-2 standard peptide . conclusively , we consider the development of novel method to be of outstanding importance to tackle some of the most urgent issue of the COVID-19 pandemic . it seem out of question that fight this pandemic urgently require interdisciplinary collaboration between virologist , clinician , and analytical chemist .   COVID-19 — the Long Road to Recovery in view of the multiple complication associate with “ long Covid ” it be essential that during recovery old person be carefully follow by physician and other health professional . it be important to recognize that symptom fluctuate and may go away for a few day and then return . there be a need for an integrated interprofessional care model to obtain the optimum recovery after COVID-19 ( @card@ ) . the key to a good recovery be an exercise program adjust to the ability of the patient to perform it . as have be show by Izquierdo and his colleague , these program should be start in hospital and continued follow hospital ( 35–37 ) . the ViviFrail exercise program be ideally adapt to do this . also , it be essential that while in the Intensive Care Unit , patient receive as much exercise as possible ( @card@ ) . these include respiratory exercise , passive joint motion , stretch , electrical stimulation of muscle , stand at bedside and walk where possible ( @card@ ) . on discharge the exercise program should include respiratory , resistance , aerobic and balance exercise as well as a focus on make sure the activity of daily live can be adequately carry out . in view of the fatigue , exercise may need to be spread out during the day . speech therapy may need to help person who have be ventilate to regain adequate speech pattern . in addition , they can work with occupational therapy to provide a variety of form of cognitive stimulation therapy in those who have have a decline in their cognition ( @card@ , @card@ ) . dietetics need to work on create taste enhancement of food in those who have lose their sense of taste and smell . person with sarcopenia or cachexia need supplementation with 10–15g/kg/day of leucine enrich essential amino acid ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in view of the social isolation that occur during the Covid epidemic it be important that program be develop to provide socialization ( @card@ , @card@ ) . this can include telehealth program such as the “ Circle of Friends ” as enhanced use of social medium ( @card@ ) . Care should be take to screen for dysphoria/depression and provide psychological therapy when it occur ( @card@ ) . it be suggest that at discharge from hospital and at 3 month discharge from hospital all COVID-19 patient be screen for frailty with the FRAIL test ( 48–51 ) , sarcopenia with the SARC-F ( 52–55 ) , anorexia with the SNAQ ( @card@ , @card@ ) and cognitive failure with the Rapid Cognitive Screen ( RCS ) ( @card@ ) . these test be simply combine into the Rapid Geriatric Assessment ( @card@ , @card@ ) and be available in an App form ( @card@ ) . person who screen positive and need to receive appropriate therapy which need to be provide free to the individual . “ Long Covid ” be an important condition which can respond to an interprofessional team approach . its fluctuation can be frustrate both for the patient and the health care provider . an additional factor that need to be take into account be whether , in the long term , chronic subclinical chronic inflammation may lead to accelerate aging both in the periphery and as a neurodegenerative process ( @card@ , @card@ ) ?   Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency : home therapy over the last few month , the SARS-CoV2 pandemic have have an impact on chronic therapy in patient with rare disease , such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) . augmentation therapy with exogenous AAT be the only specific therapy for the lung disease associate with AATD . the biochemical and clinical efficacy of AAT therapy have be well establish in numerous studies–a dose of @card@ mg/kg per week ( Chapman et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . unfortunately , during the period of emergency , some patient have difficulty access the hospital structure for chronic therapy . this be because hospital be limit access due to pandemic reorganization and because patient with lung disease be fragile and would have a potentially high risk for contract a severe SARS-CoV2 infection . a recent study describe that withdrawal of therapy in @card@ compromise AATD patient be associate with poor health outcome as demonstrate by an increase mean ( ±standard error ) number of exacerbation per patient ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ , p = @card@ ) and an increase in the mean number of hospitalization in the same patient ( @card@ ± @card@ vs. @card@ ± @card@ , p = @card@ ) compare to the same period in the previous year ( Gazzettaufficiale , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . To avoid the abrupt cessation of augmentation therapy , it have be necessary to activate a home treatment , which be in use in only a few EU country . in Italy , even though home therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin have be authorize since @card@ ( Gazzettaufficiale , @card@ ) , it be still an unimplemented practice . home therapy for such patient should be part of the Italian long-term care system . however , due to the system’s complexity , systemic problem regard the offer of care and eligibility of service can occur owe to the lack of integration between region ' and Municipalities ' health policy . AADT augmentation therapy have be demonstrate to be well-tolerated and generally safe . few and generally mild side effect have be report and rarely require major intervention or interruption of therapy . some author describe side effect typical of intravenous infusion of protein , include delayed fever resolve spontaneously over @card@ h , urticaria , nausea , fatigue and dizziness . dyspnea , probably relate to absolute protein load in the infusion , flu-like symptom , and , rarely , anaphylactic shock have also be describe . no death relate to AATD augmentation therapy be report ( Wencker et al . , @card@ ; Stoller et al . , @card@ ) . adverse event commonly occur during the first administration . initial alpha one antitrypsin administration be recommend in a hospital setting and in the presence of experienced operator . currently , there be no literature about the outcome of safety and quality of life of AATD patient in home treatment . To reduce patient flow to the hospital and prevent human infection , AATD home therapy be activate for @card@ patient use a specific patient support program , a home care project , already activate independently throughout Italy . the program allow patient to infuse intravenous augmentation therapy at home by qualified nurse in continuous contact with the refer physician . fourteen patient in treatment for over one year and two patient with recent treatment initiation be place in patient support program . the procedure involve in administer home-based intravenous therapy with AATD be the same as in the hospital . an experienced nurse wear adequate personal protective equipment measure the vital sign , then proceed to prepare the therapy to be administer . the therapy be administer intravenously accord to the schedule . the operator remain at the patient 's home throughout the administration . in the end , the vital parameter be check again and , finally , the venous access remove . the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) be not use in all its length . we use a modify Quality of Life ( QoL ) score for our questionnaire , consist of six question ( Table 1 ) , to analyze the general state of health , subjective symptom of the patient and impact of therapy on the patient 's and family life . To date , no validate questionnaire be available to assess QoL in patient with AATD . All the individual value be define base on a 5-point scale : 1 ) many time a day/very much ; 2 ) every day/much ; 3 ) two or three time a week/not much ; 4 ) once a week/few time ; and 5 ) rarely or never/not at all . there be also a blank space where the patient could leave a comment about their experience of home therapy . the QoL score be calculate as the sum of the point obtain from question . the minimum possible score be 6 , the maximum @card@ . we compare QoL score for each patient at time zero ( during the last hospital administration session ) and after 3 month of home therapy . patient give their written informed consent and all datum be collect anonymously . a nurse experience in support patient with AATD supervise the completion of the questionnaire . written comment from patient be also record . we survey the comment to understand what be the advantage or disadvantage of home treatment perceive by the patient . the observation time be 3 month ; however , treatment be continue at home for all patient . for statistical analysis student 's t-test be use for the continuous variable . all statistical analyze be perform with SPSS ( version @card@ ; SPSS Inc. Chicago , Il , United States of America ) and p < @card@ be consider significant . Median age ( min-max ) be @card@ year ( 26–78 ) , there be seven female and nine male . ( table 2 ) all patient continue home treatment without interruption . the same nurse support the patient at time zero and after three month , the questionnaire be administer , on both occasion , on the day schedule for replacement therapy . during the observation time , no adverse event occur . All the questionnaire complete at 3 month show an increase in score compare to the questionnaire complete during the last hospital administration session . the quality of life have improve from an index of @card@ ± @card@ at the start time ( t0 ) to an index of @card@ ± @card@ after 3 month ( t3 ) . ( Figure 1 ) the variation be statistically significant ( p < @card@ ) . for all patient , the score of the symptom control question ( “ I cough ” , “ I bring up phlegm ” , “ I have shortness of breath ” , “ I have attack of wheeze ” ) be unchanged . instead , all sixteen patient , when ask \" my ( augmentation ) therapy interfere with my life \" , answer \" very much \" or \" much \" at time zero , and “ few time ” or \" not at all \" after three month . also , to the question \" my respiratory disease be a nuisance to my family , friend or neighbor ? \" the same patient respond \" very much \" or \" much \" at time zero and \" few time \" or \" not at all \" after three month . Seven patient provide written comment . Three explain that the advantage of home therapy be to be independent of a family member or friend who have to accompany them to the hospital . Three other write that they could undergo home therapy without lose working or university day . these patient reported be very stress while go to the hospital to undergo intravenous therapy . this be especially true for patient who live far away from the hospital . only one patient report feel safe when he be treat at the hospital than at home because he feel he be monitor more carefully . augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin slow disease progression ( Chapman et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) and discontinuation of treatment be associate with poor health outcome , increase number of exacerbation and hospitalization ( Alkins and O’Malley , @card@ ; Sclar et al . , @card@ ; McElvaney et al . , @card@ ) . some study conclude that augmentation therapy be a cost-effective strategy for manage AATD patient with COPD ( Alkins and O’Malley , @card@ ; Sclar et al . , @card@ ) . an observational study among Spanish patient also show that these patient experience a significant decrease in hospitalization cost and incidence of exacerbation follow the start of augmentation therapy ( Barros-Tizón et al . , @card@ ) . despite the know benefit , some patient have difficulty start treatment or continue it . in a recent publication , the most frequently report practical difficulty with AATD infusion be infusion time , frequency of infusion , overbooked outpatient clinic , and treatment provide by only one center . many patient also find it difficult to reach the hospital because they reside far away . clinician , try to improve the convenience of AATD patient in therapy , often consider alternative dose strategy ( bi-weekly dose ) ; reason for this consideration include coverage of holiday and individual in full-time employment ( Horváth et al . , @card@ ) . Self-administration be not viable for all patient and the safety issue surround intravenous administration be the main disadvantage . home therapy be a possible strategy , available in a few country . it be the only treatment option in Ireland and France ; in Poland , regular treatment be provide at home or be available at hospital outpatient clinic ( Horváth et al . , @card@ ) . during the COVID-19 pandemic , the difficulty in access therapy be accentuate by the reduce access to hospital and the need to preserve fragile patient , therefore the patient support program be activate to avoid the interruption of therapy that many patient would have incur . all patient adhere to the home care support program and continued treatment without interruption and side effect . the quality of life measure with a short questionnaire show a positive change after three month of home therapy . the patient report being less stress undergo treatment at home , burden less on their family and friend , and feel less interference with their personal and family life . it should also be consider that some patient lose day of work or study to carry out the therapy at the hospital , while at home it can be carry out before or after work/study . our result highlight that the home care of AATD patient , who need augmentation therapy , contribute to the optimal\n",
            "care and improvement of the patient ' quality of life . again , a home-based administration be safe and demonstrate no side effect . accord to the result of other study , home care be also practicable for several year ( Wilke et al . , @card@ ) . limitation of the study be the use of a reduce version of the SGRQ currently not validate and the small number of patient . in our study , we take advantage of a free patient support program to allow patient to continue therapy at home , the cost of the specific patient support program be fully bore by Grifols Italy . consequently , the cost for the public health system be zero . however , due to the little diffusion of home therapy , to date , there be no study that compare the cost of the hospital with home assistance . in conclusion , convenience for the patient be view as the most important advantage of home treatment . the quality of life of our patient be the main objective , especially in the case of people with rare disease with progressive deterioration of daily living . large study be need to evaluate the impact on the quality of life of home therapy , the sustainability of the cost of a home treatment , the advantage in term of work day save for the patient and for the caregiver .   prevalence and severity of depression , anxiety , stress and perceive stress in hospitalize patient with COVID-19 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) be the cause of the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease-19 ( COVID-19 ) , which be associate with the ability to transmit the disease from human to human . the disease be associate with serious health problem and can be fatal [ 1 ] . as some author have suggest , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) cause by coronavirus , as the first outbreak of an infectious disease in the 21st century , be not the last one and COVID-19 be introduce as a pandemic earlier this century [ 2 ] . the outbreak be describe by the World Health Organization as Public Health Emergency of International concern ( PHEIC ) [ 3 ] . the disease have , in recent time , be associate with social disruption and worry economic consequence . these point , along with the risk of stigmatization and discrimination , can lead to mental health disorder for public and especially in patient with the disease [ 4–6 ] . with the increase in the number of infected patient and their death , many patient may experience psychological distress and physical problem [ 7 ] . unpredictability and uncertainty of the disease condition of different aspect of epidemiology and effective method of treatment , put people expose to stressful situation [ 8 ] . fear of the consequence of a deadly disease , combine with severe anxiety and mental distress , which can coincide with insomnia and the physical effect of the disease , can create unfavorable condition for patient due to the aggravation of mental health disorder [ 9–11 ] . early in the SARS epidemic , hospitalize patient raise concern such as fear , loneliness , fatigue , and anger . they experience anxiety as a result of fever and the effect of insomnia . [ @card@ ] . anxiety be see as a significant effect of epidemic with high level of involvement and risk of death , both among people who be directly involve in the disease and among the mass . this can be accompany by depression and other psychological problem [ @card@ ] . Duan et al . , note that the epidemic of disease can have negative effect on individual , emphasize the existence of psychological distress follow the spread of the COVID-19 and the need for active and appropriate intervention in this area [ @card@ ] . in this regard Zheng note the high prevalence of psychiatric disorder among survivor of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic , include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , and emphasize the importance of prevention , screening and treatment of associate psychiatric disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic [ @card@ ] . in this study , we examine the mental health status of patient with COVID-19 who be hospitalize . after become clinically stable , these patient be evaluate for some psychiatric symptom such as depression , anxiety , stress , and perceive stress . this study also have investigate the possible impact of occupational , economic and social status of patient on their mental health follow the spread of COVID-19 . examin the impact of demographic difference such as marital status in this area be another point of discussion . due to the interaction of some underlie disease such as hypertension and diabetes and psychiatric disorder [ @card@ , @card@ ] , in this study , we also investigate the relationship between these disease and related psychiatric disorder in patient with COVID-19 . this study be a cross-sectional study conduct in one of the large referral center for patient with COVID-19 require hospitalization in Alborz , Iran . Three psychiatric nurse perform initial screening of patient base on inclusion criterion to select patient to enter the project . these patient be select from inpatient in isolated treatment ward . all psychiatric nurse have complete personal protective equipment during screening . all information collect be transmit electronically . patient be consult and , if desire , enter the study after obtain informed consent . participant be tell that in addition to receive the require medical service , if they need psychological or psychiatric service during the project , they would be provide free of charge if they wish . participant in the project be adult who , base on medical record , be diagnose with COVID-19 and be clinically stable and willing to participate in the research project . be over the age of @card@ be one of the criterion for enter the study . if the patient do not want to continue the cooperation at any stage of the project , he/she would be exclude from the study . patient ‘ demographic information be collect as much as possible through patient ' medical record and be check with the patient . these include gender , age , marital status , employment status , and education . patient be assess through two questionnaire , the Depression , Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 ( Dass − @card@ ) and Perceived Stress Scale-4 ( PSS-4 ) . the project site be one of the large educational hospital center in Alborz province , Iran , where patient go for screening and treatment of COVID-19 disease or be refer to this center through primary care center . patient admit to the isolated ward with COVID-19 diagnosis be evaluate . in this study , accord to the inclusion criterion , @card@ patient be evaluate and finally @card@ patient be include in the study . DASS-21 be a suitable tool for measure depression , anxiety and stress , for research and clinical purpose and for such a purpose , be a validate tool among various ethnicity and population group [ @card@ ] . this tool have be evaluate in Iran in term of reliability and validity and its Persian version have satisfactory psychometric property and can be use by the Iranian population [ @card@ ] . they report the Cronbach’s alpha as @card@ for the total scale of the questionnaire , and @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ for depression , anxiety , and stress scale , respectively . this tool have 3 scale , each contain 7 question . the final score be also obtain through the sum of the score . each question vary from zero ( “ it doesn’t apply to me at all ” ) to 3 ( “ it apply to me completely ” ) . since this questionnaire be a shorten form of the main scale ( @card@ question ) , the final score of each subscale must be double . each of the subscales be divide into 4 category base on the score obtain : normal , moderate , severe and very severe [ @card@ ] . PSS be one of the most widely use tool for measure psychological stress in clinical and non-clinical situation . its internal consistency and validity have be show in various study [ @card@ ] . in Iran , Persian version of its various version ( include pss-4 ) have be evaluate and have satisfactory psychometric property . in a study in Iran , the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for it be @card@ [ @card@ ] . version 4 ( PSS-4 ) have 2 positive and 2negative phrase and its score range be from 0 to @card@ , and it have a triple classification base on intensity as high , moderate , and low [ @card@ ] . the obtain information be enter into the SPSS version @card@ . continuous and categorical variable be express as mean ( standard deviation ( SD ) ) and frequency ( percentage ) respectively . Chi-square be use to investigate the association between qualitative variable with mental health status . Pearson correlation test be use to assess correlation between scale of DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire . a P-value less than @card@ be consider as statistically significant . the Ethics Committee of Alborz University of Medical Sciences , Iran , have approve this research . ( IR . ABZUMS . REC.1399.011 , date : @card@ ) . in the case of each of the patient under study , who need further evaluation in term of psychiatric issue , the possibility of relevant psychiatric evaluation be provide to the patient so that , if desire , appropriate treatment could be perform . these facility be provide free of charge and only if the patient so wish . give that the research datum be base on human participant , the study be conduct accord to Helsinki rule . participant be inform of the objective of the study and its nature . they be assure that the information obtain from them would remain confidential . the total number of participant in the study be @card@ patient and all of the questionnaire be fill completely ( response rate @card@ % ) . the mean age of the patient be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) year . @card@ % be man and @card@ % be woman . @card@ % of the participant be marry and the rest be single . in term of job status , @card@ % be house-worker and 24.5%were unemployed . @card@ % be employee and @card@ % be retire . @card@ % be illiterate and equally have a diploma and the rest have a university degree . ( table 1 ) none of the patient have a history of alcohol consumption and 2.8%were smoker . @card@ % of patient have a history of substance use . among the patient study , @card@ patient ) 36.8%( have a history of psychiatric disorder , and 5 of them ( @card@ % ) have a history of take psychiatric medication . anxiety , depression and somatization be the most common disorder . the prevalence of underlie disease in hospitalize patient with COVID-19 in our study be as follow : hypertension ( @card@ % ) , diabetes mellitus ( @card@ % ) , hyperlipidemia ( @card@ % ) , ischemic heart disease ( @card@ % ) , asthma ( @card@ % ) , renal disease ( @card@ % ) , cerebrovascular accident ( @card@ % ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @card@ % ) , cancer ( @card@ % ) and rheumatological disease ( @card@ % ) . also , @card@ % of patient be take corticosteroid . average subclass score base on the overall score of the DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire on depression be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , anxiety be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , stress be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) , and the perceive stress be @card@ ( SD = @card@ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . overall , @card@ % of patient with COVID-19 have some degree of depression . severity of depression , accord to the Dass questionnaire , be @card@ % . all patient ( @card@ % ) have severe ( @card@ % ) and very severe ( @card@ % ) anxiety . regard to stress level , @card@ % of patient have some degree of stress . in the severity of stress category , @card@ % of patient have severe and very severe stress . in term of perceive stress , @card@ % of patient have high level and @card@ % have moderate level ( Fig . 2 ) . there be no statistically significant association between gender and age with depression , anxiety , stress and perception of stress . there be a statistically significant relationship between job status and the severity of depression among patient admit with COVID-19 ) P-value : 0.006( . the high prevalence of patient with severe and very severe depression be in the group of patient with freelancer . there be also a significant statistical association between education level and severity of depression ( P-value : @card@ ) . the high prevalence of patient with severe and very severe depression be observe in the group of patient with diploma and illiteracy education . be marry in patient be associate with increase anxiety ) P-value : @card@ ) . have rheumatological disease be statistically associate with stress ( P-value < @card@ ) . correlation between Scales of DASS-21 and PSS-4 questionnaire of hospitalize patient with COVID-19 be present in Table 2 . a positive strong correlation be find between depression and perceive stress ( Coefficient : @card@ , P-value : @card@ ) . a similar correlation be find between anxiety and perceive stress ( Coefficient : @card@ , P-value : @card@ ) . the average age of patient in our study be @card@ ) Std . deviation = @card@ ) year . in some other study , most hospitalize patient with COVID-19 be in the age range of 31–70 year ( @card@ % ) [ @card@ ] . regard the relationship between socioeconomic status and psychiatric disorder , in our study , the high rate of depression be in the group of patient with diploma degree and illiterate and then in the group of people with bachelor’s degree . in various study , there be a difference of opinion between the relationship between socio-economic level and education with depression , but most study point to the inverse relationship between them [ @card@ ] . also , in our study , people with a long history of freelancer and house worker be more likely to be depress than retire people and government employee . the existence of economic problem and attention to economic prospect after the COVID-19 pandemic have raise concern in the general public about meet the essential need and economic stability . this can be accompany by mental health disorder , include depression , especially in people with occupation more likely to be affect by these economic condition [ @card@ , @card@ ] . manage existing resource , pay attention to positive international experience and use the potential of social capital can be effective step in this regard [ @card@ , @card@ ] . regard the relationship between marital status and perceive stress , some study have suggest a protective role for marriage in this area as well as in anxiety [ @card@ ] . due to the uncertainty of the condition of the COVID-19 [ 8 ] . the study of the effectiveness of common protective factor in this field require further research . the role of environmental and social factor in this regard seem important . give the complexity of the condition associate with COVID-19 , an accurate interpretation of the relationship between marriage and anxiety and stress among these patient require further evaluation in other related study . One of the point of our study be the high number of patient with underlie disease among the COVID-19 patient . these underlie disease and their prevalence in our study be hypertension ( @card@ % ) , diabetes mellitus ( @card@ % ) , hyperlipidemia ( @card@ % ) , ischemic heart disease ( @card@ % ) , asthma ( @card@ % ) and more , respectively . in a systematic review and meta-analysis , the prevalence of these underlie disease or condition in people infect with SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalize patient , respectively , have be as follow : hypertension ( @card@ % ) , cardiovascular disease ( @card@ % ) , smoking history ( @card@ % ) and diabetes ( @card@ % ) [ @card@ ] . there be a similarity between our study and other study in term of the type of underlie disease associate with the COVID-19 . however , due to difference in the number of population study , it be not possible to compare the prevalence . in general , have physical illness that weaken the immune system and physical strength be a factor that exacerbate COVID-19 disease [ @card@ ] . give the purpose of this study , which assess patient with COVID-19 in term of depression , anxiety and stress , it be important to pay attention to this issue . correlation of physical and mental illness be an important challenge in modern medicine and be associate with a great deal of interaction [ @card@ ] . in our study , there be no significant relationship between underlie disease and psychiatric disorder in patient . summarize this result require large study , preferably multicenter sample with large sample size . Lim et al . describe the first COVID-19 tertiary transmission case in South Korea . they describe a 54-year-old man with no history of physical or mental illness , smoking or drug . during his hospitalization and isolation , he develop depression , insomnia , and suicidal ideation while his treatment eventually progress satisfactorily . also , the patient experienced stress in the context of people’s reaction to patient with COVID-19 , which he receive through medium report . the patient be subsequently consult by a psychiatrist and receive medication for the problem . the author cite disease-related isolation as one of the major cause of psychological symptom in patient [ @card@ ] . accord to various source , quarantine condition for various reason have negative psychological effect . these reason include long-term quarantine , insufficient information , frustration , and stigmatization . some expert also talk about its long-term negative effect . they have advise that the course of quarantine be as short as possible and that appropriate information be provide to patient [ @card@ ] . on the other hand , one of the point that have be consider in recent year be the relationship between infection cause by respiratory virus and subsequent mood disorder . as an example , in one study , the relationship between seropositivity for influenza and coronavirus with history of mood disorder be report [ @card@ ] . this focus on the biological aspect of the relationship between coronavirus disease and mood disorder . definite conclusion in this regard also need to pay attention to various factor affect this field and conduct more extensive study . example of this group of possible connection can be see in some scientific point of view [ @card@ , @card@ ] . other study have highlight high level of anxiety as a form of psychological stress , especially follow isolation to treat COVID-19 disease [ @card@ ] . in our study , all patient who be hospitalize and isolate have some degree of anxiety , and the severity of all case be severe and very severe . anxiety symptom may be mild at first , but there be a risk that they will suddenly worsen over the course of a few day [ 33]Due to the severity of anxiety symptom in hospitalize and isolate patient , and especially due to the anticipation of anxiety disorder among hospitalize patient , it seem that the use of psychological and psychiatric counseling method , in person or through online hospital system , can be an effective way to control patient ' clinical condition . the use of other anxiety reduction technique , such as progressive muscle relaxation , have be suggest by some researcher [ @card@ ] . more than one-third of the patient study have a history of psychiatric disorder . it be important to pay attention to various aspect of the psychiatric condition of patient with a history of mental health disorder [ @card@ ] . at the time of hospitalization and after clinically stability , all patient reveal anxiety and other psychiatric manifestation . accord to a review study , the overall prevalence of psychiatric disorder in the general population in Iran be @card@ % [ @card@ ] . in another study , the prevalence of mental health disorder be @card@ % . the prevalence of anxiety and somatization syndrome be high than other disorder [ @card@ ] . in a study conduct to assess the prevalence of @card@ disease and injury in Iran and neighboring country between @card@ and @card@ , one of the most significant change be increase the effect of mental disorder , in year live with disability(YLD ) . meanwhile , major depressive disorder have be one of the main cause of Yld among the Iranian population [ @card@ ] . also in a study in Iran , the prevalence of depression among patient with diabetes be estimate at @card@ % [ @card@ ] . in another study examine the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patient with maxillofacial trauma as an acute event , the prevalence of some degree of depression and anxiety be @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively [ @card@ ] . they report a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in this group than in the control group . accord to the study conduct in recent year in Iran , the prevalence of mental health disorder in Iran be increase . on the other hand , accord to various study , during the hospitalization of patient , due to acute or chronic disease , there be an increase in the prevalence of depression with anxiety among patient . these result be consistent with the result of our study , in which degree of depression and anxiety be see in @card@ % and @card@ % of hospitalize patient , respectively . Rossely et al . examine a group of hospitalize patient , note the high level of anxiety and depression among these patient compare to other individual , and emphasize the need for screening for psychiatric distress during hospitalization in different hospital ward [ @card@ ] . What we see in patient in our study be that patient with COVID-19 have a high severity of depression , anxiety , and stress , along with high level of perceive stress and it be very important to pay attention to their mental health status in addition to their medical status . Ishak et al . investigate a group of hospitalize patient and report that the prevalence of depression among these patient be between 5 and @card@ percent and an average of @card@ percent . they suggest that hospitalize patient be screen for depression . depression among hospitalize patient have be associate with poor functional outcome , bad physical health , and re-hospitalization [ @card@ ] . as note , in our study , @card@ % of patient have some degree of depression during hospitalization . in addition , Dass severity of depression scale , have severe and very severe result , in @card@ % of them , indicate a high prevalence of depression and its severity in patient . give the serious health concern of patient with COVID-19 , screening and the effective treatment of depression in these patient , along with proper follow-up after discharge , may play an effective role in improve their physical health . in a study conduct by Zatzick et al . , the status of post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , and their relationship to the patient’s subsequent occupational performance be assess @card@ month after the trauma event , and each of these be associate with a marked functional decline . they emphasize the need for early acute intervention in order to provide possible access to appropriate occupational performance in patient [ @card@ ] . give the economic problem associate with the COVID-19 pandemic , it seem that the therapeutic aspect of these patient in term of mental health disorder may have a positive effect on improve their job performance . Lee et al . examine the stress and psychological stress level of @card@ and @card@ patient in two hospital during the outbreak of SARS and one year thereafter . they have high stress level at the time of outbreak compare to the control group . the important point in their study be that one year after this study , in both group , the score of this test show that the level of stress in these patient remain high . in addition , a year after the outbreak , they still show worry level of depression , anxiety , and post-traumatic stress [ @card@ ] . give the similarity between the causative agent and the outbreak condition of SARS and COVID-19 ( although accord to many expert , COVID-19 be more worrying in term of severity and extent than SARS[49 ] ) , concern about the persistence of these demonstration be also present among these patient . in a study conduct @card@ month after the outbreak of SARS on treat SARS survivor , the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorder be @card@ % , and the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder at the time of the study be @card@ % . PTSD and subsequent depressive disorder be the most common disorder . accordingly , they describe SARS ' outbreak as a mental health catastrophe and stress the need for plan to identify and treat psychiatric disorder during other infectious epidemic [ @card@ ] . give all the available evidence and the result of our study , it be important to pay serious attention to the mental health disorder of patient with COVID-19 in order to well control possible psychiatric disorder in future . also , a review article on SARS outbreak report clear clinical symptom among patient , between @card@ % and @card@ % for depression , and 23–48 % for nonspecific anxiety . they report a high prevalence of psychiatric disorder among patient , and emphasize the need to prevent and follow up on similar condition [ @card@ ] . in another study , Chua et al . use the Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) questionnaire to examine the mental health status of hospitalize patient with SARS diagnosis . they report a significantly high level of stress among patient compare to the control group . they identify a clear link between stress and negative psychological effect [ @card@ ] . in our study , there be , in a similar situation , a significant positive statistical relationship between depression and perceive stress , as well as a positive statistical relationship between anxiety and perceive stress . there be also a positive statistical relationship between anxiety and stress . and among the group of patient with very severe depression , the high number of patient with high perceive stress be present . Depression , anxiety , stress and perceive stress be highly prevalent among patient with COVID-19 under study . there be also a high correlation between depression and anxiety with perceive stress . the high prevalence and severity of these psychiatric disorder among patient with COVID-19 emphasize the need to pay more attention to their mental health status . it seem that health policymaker need to have coherent plan for screen case and manage related situation . due to the high distribution of the disease , in order to achieve more complete result , it be recommend to conduct large study with a large sample size and in a multicenter manner .   a Unified Hierarchical XGBoost Model for Classifying Priorities for COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign General Practitioners ( GP ) will inevitably be involve in the mass vaccination against coronavirus @card@ ( COVID-19 ) . this be a substantially inevitable step , consider the widespread distribution of GP in the territory , the knowledge of the clinical and care history of individual patient , the identification of frailty patient and , above all , the situation that should be more quickly protect by vaccination coverage . unlike the flu vaccine , this vaccination campaign have be carry out with less rapidity for many reason : for great complexity in the procedure of create the vaccine , for the contingent availability of vaccine dose , for the worldwide scope/global reach of this care strategy , for the necessity of carry out the consequent administration of dose . this run the risk of create inequality both in term of health protection and in term of social benefit among individual who receive a vaccination at different time and with different priority . in the light of these consideration , it seem appropriate , therefore , to hypothesize solution that offer great objectivity in assign priority to vaccine administration . support in this direction can be expect from artificial intelligence ( Ai ) and machine learning ( ML ) solution that , apply to the clinical-assistance Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) datum of GP , could provide indication that , although not definitive , would help the doctor to establish priority to vaccine administration [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . start from a unified GP datum share protocol , the aim of this paper be to design and develop a ML algorithm , namely Hierarchical Priority Classification extreme Gradient Boosting ( HPC-XGB ) , for classify priority for COVID-19 vaccine administration use the EHR datum collect by GP . the ML model learn prioritizing subject accord to the priority selection criterion define by the interim recommendation on the target group of the anti-SARS CoV-2/Covid19 vaccination issue by the Italian Ministry of Health ( @card@ ) , which have be submit to the attention of the State-Regions Conference and that identify the prioritized category for the vaccination1 . this work contribute to the pattern recognition and clinical field for the follow reason : ( i ) it introduce a novel data-driven methodology for severity assessment and stratification of COVID-19 disease . the propose ML approach seek to provide indication that , although not definitive , would help the GP to establish the priority for vaccine administration ; ( ii ) it measure the effectiveness of the propose methodology for classify all the priority class across new unseen patient from different GP and demonstrate a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art . in particular , the propose method learn simultaneously discriminative pattern by take into account all of these priority criterion ( i. e. Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity ) , thus avoid specific bias on a single criterion ; ( iii ) it evaluate the reliability of the propose approach in the novel Italian Federation of GP EHR dataset ( namely , FIMMG_COVID ) compose of @card@ patient collect from @card@ different GP ' ( Core Data Team ) . the clinical significance of the propose approach be confirm by the integration as a clinical decision support system ( CDSS ) of the NetMedica Italia ( NMI ) platform for all NMI GP . the CDSS be currently support the GP for assign COVID-19 vaccine administration priority to their assistants2 . moreover , an in-depth analysis provide evidence on how the propose method can be exploit to localize the most discriminative predictor for predict priority class . such insight could further support the finer-grained priority classification for vaccine administration . the paper be organize as follow : in Section 2 , we provide a review of vaccine administration and Machine Learning base CDSS for clinical diagnosis . we describe the FIMMG_COVID EHR dataset 3 which we use for our investigation and the formulation and evaluation for our methodology describe in Section 4 . the result of our method be report in Section 5 , and we provide the clinical impact and conclusion in section 6 and 7 . clinical literature offer several work with the aim of provide an affordable immunization program against different disease by monitor the vaccine administration [ 3 ] . in addition to that , research have be conduct even on vaccine prioritization , allocation and ration [ 4 ] with a specific age-dependent mathematical model at the base . these work include also a Social Media sentiment analysis in order to seize public opinion on different vaccine and promote the campaign vaccination at a very large scale [ 5 ] . however , none of these work focus directly on the prediction of class priority use ML model and datum collect from GP . recently , the potential of ML application on the healthcare scenario give a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak [ 6 ] . the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic be a reminder of the importance of vaccination . indeed , it be a current and crucial priority to develop an effective and timely vaccine administration campaign towards this highly contagious disease [ 7 ] . for that reason , differently , from the current application of ML and Ai for COVID-19 [ 6 ] , we aim to answer this still unresolved and topical challenge , i. e. the prediction of priority of COVID-19 vaccine administration . beyond clinical diagnosis , disease modeling and risk stratification , the employment of machine learn for design CDSS be of practical interest . in this context , research be currently focus on bridge the gap between development and implementation of clinical Ai , by ensure a still central position to human being [ 8 ] . the generation of staggering volume of EHR datum along with the increase in computational power , storage and memory allow ML methodology to create a great opportunity to perform a wide range of complex task with impressive accuracy in healthcare and epidemiological contexts[9 ] . health informatic technology be crucial for predictive medicine provide clinician tool that be able to give information about individual at risk , disease onset and how to intervene . Data-driven technique be use to analyze this multifactorial temporal datum store in EHR to discover complex pattern and set up advanced ML model , which can manage this enormous amount of datum by predict clinical outcome and interpret particular pattern sometimes unsighted by physician . moreover , these predictive ML model can help physician to predict early-stage disease by also detect the most relevant clinical factor associate with a risk condition profile . ML technique have be widely use for extract information from such a large amount of datum and have prove useful in improve diagnosis , outcome prediction , and management of chronic disease . this include a possibility for the identification of high risk for medical emergency such as transition into another disease state , for example , the progression from pre-diabetes to T2D use routinely collect EHR datum . the state of the art ML model employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification include Decision Tree [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , RF [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , XGB [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , Linear Support Vector Machine ( Li-SVM ) , Gaussian Support Vector Machine ( G-SVM ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and Lasso Support Vector Machine ( La-SVM ) [ 1 ] . real-world datasets extract from EHRs usually own high dimensionality datum and several noisy and/or redundant feature . manage and model this amount of information may lead to several challenge such as i ) overfitting ; ii ) reduction of interpretability ; iii ) data heterogeneity and iv ) missing value . Recent research in this direction overcome the interpretability and data heterogeneity issue by propose a feature selection and encode approach which correspond respectively to correntropy regularize joint learning and deep polynomial network [ @card@ ] . still in[15 ] , the author propose a predictive model base on a support set make by vector regression model for predict the status of Alzheimer’s disease . similarly , the author in [ @card@ ] , leveraged a multiple kernel learn ( MKL ) to predict Alzheimer’s disease by model feature of different nature and select kernel with more discriminative power . with the aim to improve the generalization performance by learn a shared structure , multi-task learning ( MTL ) base approach be propose in [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] to model spatial correlation exist in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and cognitive measure . accordingly , in [ 2 ] MTL be introduce to model a spatio-temporal relationship among laboratory exam and in presence of miss annotation [ @card@ ] in order to predict complication relate to type 2 diabetes and the evolution of kidney disease . differently from all the above-cited work , our task aim to predict priority for COVID-19 vaccine administration for patient care by GP . because of these difference in the task definition with respect to other state of the art work , our task include some additional methodological challenge mainly relate to : ( i ) avoid possible bias in the prediction rule . notice how the solution of this task mainly depend on multiple clinical criterion such as Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity and ( ii ) handle categorical and ordinal datum with highly imbalanced class . this fact include the possibility to have a great focus ( great bias ) on the large priority class than the minority class . this paper have the ambition to overcome these challenge by propose a Hierarchical Priority Classification-XGBoost . differently from feature selection [ @card@ ] and MKL strategy [ @card@ ] , our approach demonstrate a natural ability to handle heterogeneous datum . moreover , in contrast to MTL approach [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , our procedure allow to simultaneously predict multiple priority class while avoid unwanted bias in the prediction rule . furthermore , alternatively to linearized sparse model , the approach propose in [ @card@ ] perform non-linear feature selection by associate a base kernel for each feature ( non-linear multiple-kernel strategy ) , thus decrease the overall interpretability . it be worth note here that , baseline ordinal regression model may not overcome these challenge , thus provide a bias in the prediction rule and on the large priority class . take into account these difference in the task definition , with the main objective to demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose solution , we decide to compare the propose ML model with respect to other regression algorithm employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification . in particular , in Section @card@ we have provide evidence of the superiority of our propose approach . some distance-based methodology widely use for pattern recognition task , could be potentially tailor to provide indication and establish priority for vaccine administration . these method may include the complex evidential distance [ @card@ ] , the complex evidential quantum dynamical model [ @card@ ] and a complex mass function [ @card@ ] that be propose to measure the difference or dissimilarity among piece of evidence . in particular , the totality of these approach be embed in the decision-making algorithm for the purpose of solve a pattern recognition task in a medical diagnosis scenario . despite the fact that all these methodology produce a promising way of model and handle uncertain information that can be integrate as loss function in a distance metric learning[23 ] , the so-called curse of dimensionality problem can emerge . in our task indeed , the nature of the problem arise with a high dimensionality and a heterogeneous set of predictor . for this reason , our methodology be specifically conceive to manage data heterogeneity issue by reduce overfitting . nowadays , information system that can support the territorial clinical network and potentially manage the entire clinical history of an individual where the information be share be need . the Italian Federation of General Practitioners ( FIMMG ) , through NMI ( a FIMMG Company ) , have design an initiative of it share among physician , with an interface available to interoperate with the rest of the healthcare ecosystem . the most suitable solution be the adoption of a Saas ( Software as a Service ) Cloud-based information system . the Saas Cloud aim to provide user an application accessible anywhere an Internet connection be available . the software and datum reside on cluster of server that deliver the service without the need to store datum locally . the management of this initiative have be entrust to NMI , with the aim of share the datum in a safe way , provide a series of service and utility available to the general practitioner who want to join . NMI’s intervention be focus on the replication in a cloud of physician ' EHR datum , accord to a standardized language . physician can access the database remotely , both with a PC and with mobile device . the NMI Cloud platform provide functionality for the individual physician but also for territorial aggregation . the most significant health event of non-hospitalized patient be store in standardized EHR table . thus , EHR datum allow trace the particular condition of patient such as rare and chronic disease , disability and medical prescription . the heterogeneity of the collected EHR field permit an analysis of the evolution of the disease progression , patient treatment and patient care . timely observation of health status datum in primary care , even in association with prolonged lifestyle and socio-economic information , be promise for predictive purpose and risk factor identification . territorial care ensure continuity of care both in the management of patient discharge from hospital after the post-COVID-19 acute phase and in the treatment of less severe post-COVID-19 follow-up at home . the criterion that have to be satisfy be the following : usability of datum , security in the transmission and storage of datum , inaccessibility of the cloud manager , accessibility to the component of the territorial care only through the release of individual credential , compliance for the patient ' right to control their personal datum in the cloud and the possible partial or total obscuration . in addition , it be necessary that the provider of cloud computing service guarantee compliance with the organizational and functional method define by current European regulatory requirement , also in term of integration between company ' information system and general practice information system . citizen be inform by their physician , on the purpose for which their sensitive datum be collect . currently , the FIMMG NMI system manage more than @card@ thousand GP with approximately @card@ million patient in total [ @card@ ] . FIMMG EHR database mainly consist of ( i ) patient-oriented datum , which include personal datum , a series of fix medical datum ( e. g. blood group , normal value for weight and pressure , etc. ) , medical history , exemption , intolerances and allergy . and ( ii ) GP-oriented datum , which include datum produce by the GP’s activity , such as outpatient visit , prescription for therapy or specialist visit , illness or various certificate , vaccination , extra service perform by the GP and patient monitoring . the standardized FIMMG EHR table be summarize below : Anagraphic : the table include the patient’s personal information , identification datum and basic health information , Monitoring : the table store demographic , anthropometric and pressure monitoring datum , Examination prescription : the table include a prescription diary provide for the storage of all clinical prescription relate to laboratory , instrumental , specialist , rehabilitation and hospital visit , Drug prescription : the table store datum relate to drug prescription , e-Prescriptions : the table store datum relate to electronic prescription , Pathologies : the table contain the patient’s pathology , exemption : the table store datum relate to patient exemption in term of exemption code , Laboratory : the table include the result of any clinical exam prescribe by the GP , Illness/accident certificate : the table include the medical certificate issue for any patient , Family history : the table contain family history datum for each patient , Assistance period : the table identify the period of assistance that bind the GP to their patient , Intolerance-Allergies : the table store datum relate to a patient’s allergy or intolerances , Clinical Diary : the table contain the GP’s clinical diary , Lifestyle : the table store information on the patient’s lifestyle , with a particular focus on alcohol and smoking habit , Admission : the table store admission information relate to the diagnosis and identification of the facility be store , Schedule : the table contain some plan activity for each patient , Vaccination : the table contain information relate to vaccine administration . the FIMMG_COVID dataset originate from a subset of the FIMMG EHR database in use at FIMMG Netmedica cloud architecture . the FIMMG_COVID dataset consist of @card@ patient collect from @card@ different GP ' EHR datum ( see Table 1 ) . the mean and standard deviation of the age of each GP’s patient group be also report . the @card@ GP ( Core Data Team ) be select from those enroll in the NMI cloud platform and they actively participate in define the priority criterion . the Core Data Team be locate in the North ( 4 GP ) , the Center ( 4 GP ) and the South ( 3 GP ) of Italy and they assist all the patient consider in the study . additionally , among the hundred of GP enroll in the NMI platform , these @card@ select be intensively involve in improve all the NMI cloud platform service . the ethical committee of University approve the experimental study and its guideline as a clinical noninterventional ( observational ) study . FIMMG_COVID dataset be anonymous and their use , detention and conservation be regulate by an agreement between the FIMMG , NMI and University . All the process be inside the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) . standard medical care ( prophylactic , diagnostic and therapeutic ) will remain under the responsibility of the individual’s GP team . All the perform analysis and the propose ML methodology be in compliance with the Ai guideline relate to Ai management plan toward a trustworthy Ai , promote human agency and oversight , robustness and safety , privacy and data governance , transparency , diversity , non-discrimination and fairness , societal and environmental well-being and accountability [ @card@ ] . the Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies table be include in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . the Anagraphic , Monitoring , and Pathologies table be select accord to @card@ the GP’s indication as to the most potential discriminative field for classify the severity of chronic disease and thus the PC class . these table result in the candidate feature display in Table 2 . the patient and GP id be the key column that be common for all table . the GP id model the annotation variability and data collection among different GP . the id DB take into account the different NMI interface the GP can handle during annotation and datum collection procedure . the employ EHR reflect the clinical use-case scenario , where not all monitoring feature be annotate uniformly across patient . as a consequence , a very sparse observation per patient correspond to each different type of monitor feature . the pathology be classify accord to the International Classification of Disease ( ICD-9 ) . the target variable be represent by the priority class define by the Core Data Team to their outpatient EHR datum ( FIMMG_COVID dataset ) accord to a unified priority selection criterion . these priority selection criterion take into account the interim recommendation on the target group of the anti-SARS CoV-2/Covid19 vaccination issue by the Ministry of Health ( document of @card@ ) , submit to the attention of the State-Regions Conference , which identify the category that should be prioritized for vaccination3 . due to the large population include in the category identify by the document , a further stratification be necessary in order to proceed with extreme rationality to the progression of vaccine administration . thus the priority class annotation be perform by GP follow these clinical criterion : age : one of the parameter that most influence the risk of the disease ; Dysautonomia : it require the presence of assistant for daily life activity ( e. g. bedding ) , thus lead to the high exposure of infection ; Chronic pathology : the concomitance of chronic pathology ( cardiovascular , respiratory , neoplastic , metabolic , neurological disease ) represent an element that significantly affect the prognosis ; obesity : it be identify from the epidemiological datum and the recent clinical literature as one of the risk factor for great COVID-19 severity and mortality [ @card@ ] . the definition of these clinical criterion be in line with the recent clinical finding [ @card@ ] that demonstrate how the age-related comorbidities have a more important weight than the age itself . All the consider criterion ( Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic Pathologies and Obesity ) be high-level clinical criterion that be not encode as annotation in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . for that reason , a ML-based approach could be suitable in order to capture discriminative and high-level pattern within the EHR feature that be hardly discoverable use ruled-based approach . all of these criterion should be take into account for design a ML model for predict priority class . in particular , the ML model should be address to focus simultaneously on find a discriminative pattern on all of these criterion without reflect a more focus on a single criterion , thus avoid specific bias on Age , Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity . follow these criterion , table 3 report the priority class identify by GP and the number of patient attribute to each priority class by the Core Data Team in the FIMMG_COVID dataset . notice how the priority class @card@ be not affect by clinical criterion and thus not consider in the perform analysis . chronic pathology include cardiovascular , respiratory , neoplastic , metabolic , neurological disorder of different entity : small , medium and severe entity . the severe entity reflect an unstable clinical condition often follow a recent episode of illness or aggravation of the underlie disease , with the compromise general condition and/or obvious organ failure . the medium entity reflect stable clinical condition with a history of recent instability , risk factor with high unpredictability of evolution . the low entity reflect stable clinical condition , the presence of morbid condition characterize risk factor and chronic disease at the low stage . follow state of the art work for predictive medicine [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] the average of each Monitoring feature ( Weight , Height , Waist circumference , Systolic Blood pressure and Diastolic Blood pressure ) be compute for each patient . a missing value occurrence ( Nan ) highlight that the monitoring exam be not available for the patient and thus be replace with zero value ( 0-value imputation ) . although the baseline XGB have a natural ability to handle missing value , by learn the good direction to handle miss value [ @card@ ] , the 0-value imputation allow to well characterize the meaning of the missing occurrence , i. e. that the monitoring exam be not available for the patient and thus be replace with 0-value . moreover , all the patient who do not have the Age feature be exclude . this fact lead to consider @card@ out of @card@ patient . the one-hot hierarchical encode procedure be use on categorical feature ( i. e. , ICD9 code of Pathologies feature ) . hence , the 1 and 0 display the presence or absence of a specific ICD9 pathology for each subject respectively . since the level of detail among code category vary greatly [ @card@ ] , the @card@ most frequent ICD9-macro category ( i. e. the first 3 digit of ICD9 code ) be encode ( see Table 4 ) . the propose HPC-XGB consist of two hierarchical layer of different XGBoost model . the XGBoost method be apply as a prediction model for each layer in consideration of its characteristic of high generalization performance , and the low risk of overfitting and high interpretability that outperform other datum mine method widely use for solve predictive medicine task use tabular datum , i. e. EHR datum [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] . the gradient tree boost algorithm extend the concept of adaptive boost by sequentially add predictor and correct previous model use the gradient descent algorithm [ @card@ ] . although traditional method employ univariate and multivariate statistical analysis to answer pattern discrimination question , the application of a machine learn approach base on the XGB model improve the sensitivity of detection and generalization performance by combine multiple information across several variable ( i. e. , high dimensional problem and data heterogeneity ) with relative low sample datum . moreover , the exact aim of our work be to create a model that could be integrate into a Clinical Decision Support System ( CDSS ) with no need to apply human intervention during the preprocessing stage . indeed , since XGB make no assumption on data distribution and use individual decision tree , it be potentially unaffected by multi-collinearity . for the FIMMG_COVID dataset N examples/patients with m=29 feature be consider for the training stage . the Yi∈PC be the label of the ith patient sample Xi∈Rm . the tree ensemble model use K additive function to predict the output as follow : ( 1)y^i=ϕ(Xi)=∑k=1Kfk(Xi ) , fk∈F where F be the space of regression tree . therefore the following regularize empirical loss function be minimize : ( 2)L(ϕ)=∑iL(y^i , yi)+∑kΩ(fk)where(3)Ω(f)=T+12λ∥w∥2 T be the depth of the tree , L be a differentiable convex loss function that measure the difference between the prediction y^i and the target yi , Ω(f ) be the regularization term which control the complexity of the model via the T and λ hyperparameters . the hyperparameters T and λ be optimize in the validation set in term of maximum depth of a tree and l2 penalty ( see Table 5 ) . the loss function be minimize in an iterative manner as follow : ( 4)L(t)=∑i=1NL(yi , y^i(t−1)+ft(Xi))+Ω(ft)where y^i(t ) be the prediction of the i-th instance at the t-th iteration . the standard exact greedily algorithm enumerate over all the possible split on all the feature and select the good split for minimize the Equation 4 . since it be computationally demand to enumerate all the possible split for candidate feature the XGBoost extension introduce a theoretically justify weighted quantile sketch for approximate learning . moreover , a sparsity-aware algorithm for handle sparse datum ( miss value ) be adopt [ @card@ ] . the propose HPC-XGB be describe in Figure 2 and all the calculation step be describe in Algorithm 1 . the Age be one of the parameter that most influence the risk of the disease and thus the classification of priority class . however , the aim be to enforce the ML algorithm to focus not only on a single criterion ( e. g. thus avoid specific bias on Age ) , but instead to learn discriminative pattern on specific patient condition also relate to Dysautonomia , Chronic pathology and obesity . for that reason , our ordinal problem be split into two classification layer ( Layer A and Layer B ) . in the first layer , task A be define as the classification between the high vulnerable patient and the other category . notice how this task do not only depend on age but on all consider clinical criterion : ( 5 ) where YiA=0 ∀ PCi={1⋯7,9⋯22,24⋯26 } , YiA=1 ∀ PCi={8 } . the weighted logistic loss function be use as the objective function of the XGB A : ( 6)L(y^iA , yiA)=1N∑i=1NN1AyiAln(1+e−y^iA)+N0A(1−yiA)ln(1+ey^iA ) where N1A and N0A be the number of training patient belong to YiA=1 and YiA=0 respectively . follow the rationale describe by Eq . 4 , the second layer B be design by cluster each sub-task B relate to the YiA=0 where the target class be independent with the Age feature for at least one subset of patient collect by one GP : ( 7)where s=1⋯7 be the total number of sub-tasks B , GPid∈{1 , ⋯,11 } be the GP id , YGPid , Bs⊂PC be the associated label for the sub-task B and GP id and XageGPid , Bs⊂XageBs be the predictor for the sub-task B and GP id . the independence of binary subtasks |YBs|=2 be measure accord to a Mann-Whitney U test , a nonparametric statistical significance test for determine whether two independent sample be draw from a population with the same distribution . in particular , the statistical test point out that for each sub-task YBs there be at least one subpopulation from one GP where it be not possible to reject the null hypothesis ( α=0.05 ) that there be no difference in the distribution of the XageGPid , B between the two associated label ( YGPid , Bs⊂PC ) . similarly , the independence of multiclass subtasks |YBs|>2 be measure accord to a Kruskal Wallis test , a generalization of the Mann-Whitney U test for the case of multiple distribution . notice how each subtask B be focus to discriminate the PC in a specific age range . indeed , this classification be mainly dependent from the other clinical criterion ( i. e. dysautonomia , chronic pathology and obesity ) . the weighted logistic loss function be use as the objective function of the XGB B for solve binary sub-tasks : ( 8)L(y^iBs , yiBs)=1NBs∑i=1NBsN1BsyiBsln(1+e−y^iBs)+N0Bs(1−yiBs)ln(1+ey^iBs ) where NBs be the number of training patient for the subtask B , N1Bs and N0Bs be the number of patient belong to the binary class ( YBs⊂PC ) . the weighted categorical cross-entropy loss ( soft-max loss ) be use as the objective function of the XGB B model for solve multi-class sub-tasks : ( 9)L(y^iBs , yiBs)=−1NBs∑k=1CNcBsyikBsln(1+e−y^ikBs ) Notice how the additional weight introduce in the employ loss function ( see ( 6 ) , ( 8 ) , ( 9 ) ) , allow to deal with the naturalistic imbalanced setting of this task . the predictive performance of the propose HPC-XGB be evaluate for solve task a ( vulnerability ) and subtasks B ( severity of disorder ) . the predictive performance be evaluate accord to the follow measure : accuracy : the percentage of correct prediction ; macro-recall :\n",
            "the recall be calculate for each class and then take the unweighted mean . the recall reflect the percentage of true positive over the condition positive ( sensitivity ) ; confusion matrix : the square matrix that show the type of error in a supervised paradigm ; false positive rate : the false positive rate for task a ; false negative Rate ( FNR ) : the false negative rate for task a ; receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve : be design by plot the true positive rate ( TPR ) against the false positive rate ( FPR ) at various threshold setting . it illustrate the performance of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold be vary . from now on we refer to the recall , False Positive Rate and False negative rate as recall , FPR and FNR respectively . it be worth note here that , the goal of our paper be to establish the priority to COVID-19 vaccine administration and the FIMMG_COVID dataset be currently the only dataset for this . however , we decide to compare the propose HPC-XGB with respect to other ML algorithm employ in literature for disease modeling , disease prediction and risk stratification . these state of the art ML model include Decision Tree [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , RF [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , XGB with different loss function ( mean square errro , tweedie and gamma ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , Linear Support Vector Machine ( Li-SVM ) , Gaussian Support Vector Machine ( G-SVM ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and Lasso Support Vector Machine ( La-SVM ) [ 1 ] . since our goal be to solve an ordinal regression task ( classification of @card@ PC ) , as comparison , the regression formulation of these model be adopt . in the experimental comparison we have further include the feature selection and ensemble of support vector regression approach propose in [ @card@ ] along with the multi-task regression-based approach propose in [ @card@ ] [ @card@ ] . similarly to [ @card@ ] , we train different La-SVM use different feature modality ( Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies ) . the final prediction be achieve by average the single model prediction . as a comparison , we also employ a similar MTL strategy employ in [ @card@ ] . different from the linearized sparse model , the approach propose in [ @card@ ] perform non-linear feature selection by associate a base kernel for each feature ( non-linear multiple-kernel strategy ) , thus decrease the interpretability . hence , we adopt as a comparison the linearized MTL strategy for feature learn ( l2,1MTL ) . notice how in the l2,1 MTL comparison the task a and task B be solve simultaneously by learn a similar sparse feature structure . the experimental comparison aim to evaluate the potential of the propose HPC-XGB for classify all @card@ PC . by perform these comparison the aim be to measure how the HPC-XGB be able to improve the state-of-the-art methodology in order to firstly discriminate the highly vulnerable class ( PC=8 ) and at the same time to provide a classification among different age-dependent PC . hence , three different testing procedure be perform and they be relate to : ( i ) testing procedure a ) : performance be evaluate with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class ) for predict PC 8 with respect to the other PC class . we measure the performance of test procedure a ) in term of overall accuracy , recall , FPR and FNR ; ( ii ) testing procedure b ) the performance be evaluate with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class except class 8 ) for predict all PC class except class 8 . we measure the performance of test procedure b ) in term of overall accuracy and recall . since the testing procedure b ) can be conceive as a standard regression task we also evaluate the performance in term of Mean Absolute Error ( Mae ) , Mean Square Error ( MSE ) and coefficient of determination ( R2 score ) ; ( iii ) testing procedure c ) the performance be evaluate with respect to the well competing state-of-the-art classification model train for each subtask . the performance of testing procedure be measure c ) in term of average accuracy and recall . for all the experimental comparison and testing procedure , the recall be the selected metric optimize in the validation set . the rationale behind the optimization of the recall in the validation set be justify by the fact to achieve an objective that be more clinically relevant for a screening purpose . thus , the author , follow this rationale , preferred to minimize the false negative and achieve a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity . this choice have be also perform accord to the most recent state-of-the-art approach in predictive medicine scenario [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . hence , to test HPC-XGB for a significant difference from chance-level classification , the one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( significance level = @card@ ) be perform compare the recall distribution with respect to the level of chance ( i. e. @card@ for the binary task and 1/C for the multi-class task ) . moreover , the non-parametric one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( significance level = @card@ ) be also use to test the overall performance of the HPC-XGB for a significant difference from the general performance of the state of the art model ( test procedure a ) and b ) ) and to perform a statistical comparison between the HPC-XGB and the good standard supervise learn competitor ( testing procedure c ) . table 5 summarize the range of the hyperparameters optimize for each ML model during the LOGPO procedure . table 6 show the predictive performance of the HPC-XGB for each task . we report the average and the standard deviation of accuracy and recall across all run of the LOGPO procedure . for the task a the HPC-XGB achieve the good performance ( accuracy = 0.854(0.060 ) , recall = 0.768(0.109 ) ) . for all the B subtasks except B1 , the performance of HPC-XGB be significantly high than the chance level . this fact can be motivate by the high imbalanced setting of task B1 : only a few patient ( @card@ , less than 4 % ) have the PC equal to @card@ . with the purpose of provide additional proof behind our feature extraction step , we perform additional experiment by ( i ) consider all ICD-9 pathology category and ( ii ) include the one-hot hierarchical encode of exemption and drug prescription with all ICD-9 pathology category . the additional experiment ( i ) and ( ii ) highlight a decrease of the averaged-recall of 4 % and 7 % respectively , for solve Task A. as a result , the @card@ feature constitute the most discriminative predictor to feed our HPC-XGB methodology figure 4 show the recall and the ROC and the Area under Curve ( AUC ) of HPC-XGB for each subset of patient assign by different GP in each run of LOGPO procedure for solve task A. Notice how the recall and the AUC remain always above chance level . the theoretical complexity of the propose model depend on the maximum depth of the tree ( T ) and the # of estimator ( EI ) . however , the block structure for parallel learning and the approximate algorithm [ @card@ ] be employ for reduce the training complexity , especially when N be high . the time complexity can be compute as O(EITN+NlogB ) where B be the maximum number of row in each block and depend on the number of the CPU core , thus achieve , a competitive gain with respect to standard gradient boost algorithm O(EITNlogN ) . the experimental computation time analysis for the training and for the testing stage be perform in Table 7 . the computation time for the training stage be compute by consider only the outer loop of the LOGPO procedure , i. e. once the hyperparameter tune procedure be complete ) ( see Figure 3 ) . the propose HPC-XGB algorithm achieve a competitive computation time for both the training ( less than @card@ sec ) and test stage ( less than @card@ sec ) for solve Task A and each B subtasks . All the experiment be reproducible , and they be perform use a @card@ GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core with 16GB of Ram . the comparison with respect to the state of the art be perform use the testing procedure a ) , b ) and c ) describe in @card@ . in the testing procedure a ) ( see Table 8 ) we evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class ) for predict PC 8 with respect to the other PC class . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) and the baseline XGB in term of recall of about @card@ % and @card@ % respectively for classify high vulnerable subject ( PC=8 ) . in the test procedure b ) ( see Table 9 ) we evaluate the performance with respect to the state-of-the-art regression model ( train on all PC class except class 8 ) for predict all PC class except class 8 . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) and the baseline XGB in term of recall of about @card@ % and @card@ % respectively for classify all age-related class . in the test procedure c ) ( see Table @card@ ) we compare the good performing state of the art model ( DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) train for each subtask with respect to the propose HPC-XGB . the propose HPC-XGB model overcome significantly the good competitor ( i. e. DT [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ) in term of recall for classify subtask B2 , B3 , B4 , B6 and B7 . To provide insight into the model interpretability ( see Figure 5 ) , the most discriminative predictor for classify priority class be highlight . in particular , we compute the importance of each input feature in our HPC-XGB by consider the number of time a feature be use to split the datum across all tree . then , we average the importance across each LOGPO run . the compute feature importance value be normalize from 0 to 1 with respect to all element . notice how although the age be one of the most discriminative predictor for solve task A , B3 , B5 , B7 , other clinical factor ( i. e. the presence of a specific pathology ) represent the most discriminative predictor for solve task B2 , B4 ( icd9_464 acute laryngitis and tracheitis ) and for solve task B6 ( icd9_522 disease of pulp and periapical tissue ) . a preliminary validation make by the Core Data Team confirm how the model interpretability result of our study provide novel insight into the good combination of conventionally and non-conventionally use feature for discriminate vulnerability and disease severity . moreover , the high feature importance of GP id demonstrate the high variability of the annotation procedure that can be subjectively condition by the GP itself and the GP’s knowledge of the patient’s medical history . further clinical validation of the overall CDSS be perform on an additional dataset of @card@ patient collect by other @card@ GP . in the first analysis , the @card@ GP focus on reanalyzing only the misclassify patient by the ML algorithm , with the purpose of verify whether the predict PC be more effective compare to their previous annotation . the main objective of this analysis be to inspect how the propose CDSS , in some situation , be also able to offer a more effective PC proposal than GP by discover particular pattern that can be sometimes unsighted by physician . we find how the GP revise their annotation in @card@ % of the total of misclassify patient , by confirm the correct prediction of the ML algorithm . moreover , we evaluate the generalization power of the propose CDSS by propagate the error between layer and by evaluate the accuracy between all the predict PC and the ground-truth label for each different tolerance threshold . the predict PC be consider correct if its deviation with respect to the ground-truth label fall within a specific threshold . thus , a great threshold reflect a more tolerance to the misclassification error of the model . our model correctly predict the PC class up to an overall accuracy of @card@ % with a tolerance threshold of ±6 ( see Figure 7 ) . this outcome be also in line with the clinical and ethic guideline in order to provide a CDSS base on ML that be as align as possible with the GP ( human agency and oversight , [ @card@ ] ) . the COVID-19 outbreak pose an unprecedented challenge for policymaker and healthcare worker across the world , by highlight the need for preventive and precise solution capable to provide clinical support for the treatment and management of the COVID-19 patient . in conclusion , our work have the potential to play a fundamental role in this scenario , for the development of learn healthcare system , that may support the vaccination campaign by provide indication that although not definitive , would help the GP to establish the priority to vaccine administration . we also demonstrate the high level of generalization of the propose HPC-XGB approach across new unseen patient from different GP . One limitation of the propose approach lie in consider only static predictor ( i. e. Anagraphic , Monitoring and Pathologies field ) in the propose ML model . interesting future work in this context may be address to consider the temporal observation of laboratory exam . although we can have a limited and sparse set of exam for each patient , a multiple-instance-based approach may encourage a temporal structure of the value of the exam for each patient while deal with the sparse nature of this task [ @card@ ] . To well integrate ordinal structure among class , and to further minimize the error between distant class , another interesting future direction would be to extend the HPC-XGB methodology for impose an ordinal constraint among priority class within the age-related subtasks . this may involve the introduction of an ordinal loss ( e. g. quadratic weight kappa loss [ @card@ ] ) in the HPC-XGB for penalize the misclassification error that be further from the correct class . the author declare that they have no compete interest .   manage pneumonia through facility-based integrated management of childhood management ( IMCI ) service : an analysis of the service availability and readiness among public health facility in Bangladesh Bangladesh be one of the few high burden country with limited resource which achieve the ambitious MDG-4 target of reduce the under-5 mortality rate by two-third ) ahead of @card@ [ 1 , 2 ] . despite this commendable accomplishment , Bangladesh still suffer one of the high under-5 mortality rate in the world [ 3 ] . accord to the late Demographic and Health Survey conduct in @card@ , the under-5 mortality in Bangladesh be @card@ per thousand live birth , indicate an apparent stall in the rate of reduction from the @card@ estimate of @card@ per thousand live birth [ 2 , 3 ] . with an estimated @card@ death per year , pneumonia account for @card@ % of all under-5 death , make it the single large cause of death among young child [ 4 ] . therefore , achieve the ambitious 2030-SDG target of reduce the under-5 mortality to @card@ per thousand live birth or below will require strategic focus , substantial investment and concerted effort by all stakeholder by prioritisation of pneumonia at every stage [ 5 , 6 ] . cognizant of the high burden of pneumonia morbidity and mortality in the majority of Low- and Middle-Income Countries ( LMICs ) , the World Health Organization ( who ) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund ( UNICEF ) set forth an ambitious goal to end all preventable death due to pneumonia by @card@ [ 5 ] . Bangladesh declare its commitment to reduce the pneumonia specific mortality rate among child less than 5 year of age from eight death per thousand live birth to three death per thousand live birth by @card@ by implement who and UNICEF’s Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea ( GAPPD ) [ 5 ] . ensure timely and appropriate management of pneumonia through outpatient and inpatient care be one of the key component of GAPPD’s ‘ prevent-protect-treat ' strategy [ 5 ] . for outpatient management of common childhood illness , include pneumonia , the global recommendation be to adopt the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) strategy in high-burden and low-resource setting [ 7 , 8 ] . IMCI have demonstrate a positive impact in improve health worker ' performance and quality of care as well as reduce childhood mortality , include pneumonia in setting with limited resource [ 9–16 ] . however , success depend on the effective implementation of the three basic pillar outline in the IMCI strategy , which include improve health worker ' skill , improve the health system to ensure supply of essential item to provide quality service , and improve family and community practice [ 17–20 ] . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be among the first step towards strengthen the health system [ @card@ , @card@ ] . they be also fundamental to ensure the provision of care , which be one of the core component of WHO’s Quality of Care Framework [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the government of Bangladesh ( GoB ) adopt the IMCI strategy in @card@ , and facility-based IMCI be scale up in all district ( @card@ ) and more than @card@ % of all sub-districts ( @card@ ) by @card@ [ @card@ , @card@ ] . accord to the current programme implementation model , IMCI service be provide through a dedicated corner ( i. e. IMCI corner ) at the outpatient department in all district and sub-district level hospital [ @card@ , @card@ ] . at the sub-district level , IMCI service be provide through union-level health centre . doctor , nurse or paramedic ( locally know as SACMOs ) with special in-service training be responsible for provide IMCI service [ @card@ , @card@ ] . unfortunately , there be little evidence regard the current status of service availability , readiness and quality of care render through IMCI service in Bangladesh . such information , particularly those that be relate to pneumonia management , be critical for understand the health system bottleneck and take course corrective measure to achieve the ambitious 2025-GAPPD and 2030-SDG target . this paper attempt to address this critical evidence gap by present the status of IMCI service , explicitly focus on the service availability and readiness relate to IMCI-based pneumonia management in Bangladesh , stratify by rural-urban , administrative division and type of health facility . we conduct a secondary analysis of the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey ( BHFS ) , which be conduct in @card@ with a nationally representative sample of health facility [ @card@ ] . the survey include all type of public hospital and health centre as well as some private and Ngo hospital with at least @card@ inpatient bed . the survey be carry out by the National Institute of Population Research and Training ( NIPORT ) with technical assistance from ICF International ( USA ) and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( icddr , b ) . datum be collect by associate for Community and Population Research ( ACPR ) , Dhaka , a private research agency appoint by NIPORT for this survey . Bangladesh be divide into eight administrative division ( Barisal , Chittagong , Dhaka , Khulna , Rajshahi , Rangpur , Sylhet , and Mymensingh ) , which be subdivide into @card@ district ( zilas ) , and further divide into @card@ sub-districts ( upazilas ) . the public health system in Bangladesh have three tier of referral hospital and two type of health centre . at the district level , there be Medical College Hospitals as tertiary level referral hospital , District Hospitals ( DHs ) as secondary level referral hospital with 250–500 bed . at the sub-district level , there be Upazila Health Complexes ( UHCs ) as primary level referral hospital with @card@ bed . below the sub-district level , there be Union Health and Family Welfare Centres ( UH&FWCs ) and Community clinic ( CCs ) and ) as health centre . in addition , there be Maternal and Child Welfare Centres ( MCWCs ) in all district and few sub-districts with @card@ bed . DHs have a catchment population of around 2–3 million , while it be 250,000–300,000 for UHCs , 25,000–30,000 for UH&FWCs and 6000–10,000 for CCs . the survey adopt a stratify random sampling procedure where the health facility be stratify accord to their administrative unit and type of facility . all division and the follow type of health facility be include in the survey : DHs , MCWCs , UHCs , UH&FWCs , CCs , and private hospital and Ngo clinic with at least @card@ bed . in BHFS-2017 , datum be successfully collect from @card@ health facility ( @card@ % response rate ) . from each facility , an average of eight health care provider , who provide the range of service be assess , be select for interview . in facility with less than eight health care provider , all provider present on the day of the visit be interview . a total of @card@ provider be interview [ @card@ ] . BHFS @card@ use two type of questionnaire for datum collection : a facility inventory questionnaire and a health care provider interview questionnaire . the facility inventory questionnaire be use to collect datum relate to the service availability and readiness of each priority service . the health care provider interview questionnaire be use to collect information relate to the level of education , training , clinical experience , and supervision receive by a sample of health care provider from each facility . the datum collection team consist of @card@ medical doctor and @card@ paramedic who receive three week of training from @card@ July to @card@ July @card@ in Dhaka . datum be collect between @card@ July and @card@ October @card@ . additional detail be available in the BHFS-2017 report [ @card@ ] . datum be analyse use Stata version @card@ ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) . accord to the national IMCI programme , all DHs , MCWCs , UHCs and UH&FWCs be mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service through outpatient department [ @card@ , @card@ ] . therefore , in this paper , we limit our analysis to DHs ( n = @card@ ) , UHCs ( n = @card@ ) , UH&FWCs ( n = @card@ ) , and MCWCs ( n = @card@ ) , which be consistently use as denominator throughout the analysis . the National Newborn Health Programme and IMCI ( NNHP&IMCI ) of Directorate General of Health Services ( DGHS ) , Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ( MoH&FW ) , Bangladesh have an approve list of essential equipment , drug and logistic for IMCI service in Bangladesh . a consultative workshop be organise with the national expert under the leadership of IMCI Programme to review the IMCI-list and identify item ‘ require ' for pneumonia management base on the facility-basedIMCI guideline . the national expert identify @card@ item as ‘ require ' , which be categorise into four domain : A. staff , B. equipment , C. medicine and D. logistic & job aid . out of these @card@ item , @card@ be available , and three be absent in the BHFS-2017 tool . however , we identify proxy item ( disposable syringe instead of Insulin syringe or 5 cc syringe ; monthly report form instead of IMCI reporting form ) in the tool for two of the absent item . the national expert also identify @card@ item from the list of @card@ required item as essential for manage pneumonia base on facility-based IMCI guideline . supplementary Table 2 present the list of essential item . a ten-point score system be develop to measure the minimum pneumonia management readiness of designate health facility . the availability of each of the essential item be give an equal score of one . then , the facility be categorise as ‘ poor readiness : score 0–4 , ‘ moderate readiness : score 5–7 and ‘ high readiness : score 8–10 . the score system be develop in consultation with national expert and IMCI programme management team . figure 1 summarise the item identify by the Technical Committee and their availability in BHFS @card@ tool . service availability be define as facility offer curative child care and report to provide the service base on facility-based IMCI guideline . readiness be define as the presence of required item list in Fig . 1 on the day of the visit . supplementary Table 1 present the operational definition of readiness for each of the require item . descriptive statistic ( proportion ) be use to report availability and readiness for each item . the estimate be stratify by facility type ( DHs , UHCs , UH&FWCs , MCWCs ) , location ( rural and urban ) and administrative division . in addition to the required and essential item , we present the readiness of IMCI facility regard the oxygen system . in addition to pulse oximetry ( which be already include as a required item ) , the follow item be include for present oxygen system readiness : availability of oxygen concentrator , availability of oxygen cylinder with flow meter , availability of oxygen cylinder without flow meter , and availability of oxygen distribution system . table 1 describe the background characteristic of the public health facility , which be mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh and include in this analysis . all of the DHs and the majority ( @card@ % ) of the MCWCs be situate in urban area . regard UHCs , around half be locate in urban area . in contrast , almost all the UH&FWCs be locate in rural area . among all the facility , around one-fifth be in Barisal and Chittagong division each while rest of the division , contribute around @card@ % each . figure 2 summarise the service availability relate to pneumonia management in public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . curative child care be almost universally available across all type of facility . more than @card@ % of DHs and UHCs report provide IMCI service ( include pneumonia management ) , whereas such service be available in three-fourth of UH&FWCs and MCWCs . around @card@ % of DHs and UHCs have IMCI corner . however , the availability be extremely low ( 9 % ) in MCWCs . UH&FWCs be not mandate to establish specific corner for provide IMCI service ; therefore the finding for this facility have be present as ‘ not applicable ' . figure 3 illustrate the readiness relate to the management of pneumonia in different type of public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . the availability ( on the day of the visit ) be present for each of the item ( present in Fig . 1 ) require for manage pneumonia accord to facility-based IMCI guideline . around @card@ % of the facility have a staff ever train in facility-based IMCI guideline , and @card@ % have a copy of the IMCI chart booklet on the day of the visit . regard equipment , the thermometer be available in @card@ % of facility . weigh scale ( child or infant ) be available in half of the facility . only one-third of the facility have an Ari timer or a watch that can record time in second on the day of the visit . pulse oximetry be available in only 6 % of facility . more than @card@ % of the facility have amoxicillin syrup or dispersible tablet on the day of the visit . however , the availability of injection gentamicin be only @card@ % . an Insulin syringe or disposable 5 cc syringe be available in @card@ % of facility . although monthly reporting form be available in @card@ % of facility , around one-third of the facility do not have an IMCI service register to document their care practice . table 2 present the readiness ( availability of required item on the day of the visit ) relate to the management of pneumonia in public health facility mandate for provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh , disaggregated by facility type , location and division for each of the readiness item . DHs and UHCs demonstrate high level of readiness than UH&FWCs for the majority of the item . the readiness of UH&FWCs be particularly low ( less than half of DHs ) for IMCI chart booklet , weigh scale , Ari timer , pulse oximeter , injection gentamicin , injection diazepam and IMCI register . similarly , the readiness be high among urban-facilities than that of rural-facilities across all item . pulse oximetry be available in only @card@ % of the district hospital and @card@ % of the UHCs . none of the UH&FWCs have a pulse oximeter on the day of the visit . no obvious pattern be observe regard the readiness across different division . more than two-third of UHCs have both IMCI trained staff and guideline , but around a quarter of MCWCs and union facility have both . similar gap be identify of all other domain . figure 4 present the readiness base on ten essential item for manage pneumonia in public health facility mandate to provide facility-based IMCI service in Bangladesh . the score denote the number of item available on the day of the visit . out of the facility survey , only @card@ % have a high level of readiness with an overall readiness score of 8–10 , whereas @card@ % have a low level of readiness with an overall score of 0–4 . when stratify by facility type , DH and UHC show a high level of readiness than that of UH&FWCs ( @card@ % for DHs , @card@ % for UHCs and 8 % for UH&FWCs , p < @card@ ) . facility locate in urban area have a much high level of high readiness ( @card@ % ) than facility locate in rural area ( @card@ % ) ( p < @card@ ) . the readiness pattern be similar across all administrative division . supplementary Figure 1 illustrate that no facility have all of the ten essential item available on the day of the visit . around 5 % of the DHs and UHCs have all essential item , whereas only 1 % of MCWCs and no union facility have all essential item . figure 5 illustrate the readiness relate to oxygen source in public health facility in Bangladesh . around @card@ % of the DHs and one-thirds of the UHCs and MCWCs have a function oxygen concentrator on the day of the visit . more than half ( 52–65 % ) of the DHs , UHCs and MCWCs have oxygen cylinder with flow meter . besides , around half of the DHs and UHCs , and one-third of the MCWCs have oxygen cylinder without flowmeters on the day of the visit . around @card@ % of the district hospital have an oxygen distribution system , but none of UHCs , UH&FWC and MCWCs have this . the availability of any of the four oxygen source be the high in UHCs ( @card@ % ) follow by DHs ( @card@ % ) and MCWCs ( @card@ % ) . oxygen availability be particularly low ( 5 % ) in UH&FWCs . pneumonia be the large killer of child under five year of age in Bangladesh , and IMCI be one of the key strategy adopt by the government of Bangladesh for managing pneumonia [ 3 , @card@ , @card@ ] . the success of IMCI service will greatly influence Bangladesh’s progress towards achieve the GAPPD target of prevent all avoidable pneumonia-related death by @card@ [ 5 ] . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be the step stone for health system strengthening and critical to promote the quality of care render through IMCI service [ @card@ ] . this be the first study to report the service availability and readiness relate to IMCI-based pneumonia service in Bangladesh through a nationally representative sample . this study identify that there be substantial gap in staff train in IMCI service , availability of essential item like functional Ari timer or watch that can record time in second , pulse oximeter , register and report form for documentation , and necessary medicine for provide IMCI-based pneumonia management . moreover , there be critical gap in the availability of oxygen source in the survey facility . who develop the IMCI strategy in the mid-1990 , which incorporate key lesson from WHO’s Global Acute Respiratory Infection Control Programme launch in 1980s [ @card@ ] . the government of Bangladesh adopt the IMCI strategy immediately after that , and the process of health system integration and national scale-up be complete through its inclusion in the National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 and Essential Service Package [ @card@ , @card@ ] . accord to the current National Health Sector Programme 2017–22 , all type of public facility ( DH , UHCs , UH&FWCs and MCWCs ) be mandate to provide curative child care through IMCI service [ @card@ , @card@ ] . our analysis reveal that almost all facility offer child curative service , but there be substantial gap regard the availability of IMCI service in UH&FWCs and MCWCs . the divide between the two directorate of the Ministry of Health and the difference in their strategic focus can potentially explain such contrast picture . all DHs and UHCs be under the DGHS , however , the majority of the UH&FWCs and all MCWCs be under the Directorate General of Family Planning ( DGFP ) [ @card@ , @card@ ] . historically , DGHS be involve in the introduction and scale-up of IMCI service in Bangladesh , and they have a specific programme name after IMCI ( NNHP&IMCI ) . on the other hand , the prime mandate of DGFP be to promote and provide family planning service . child curative care be incorporate into DGFP’s mandate as an expansion of the existing family planning service . also , there be gap in coordination between the IMCI programme of DGHS and the child health programme of DGHS . accord to the current health sector programme , all DHs , UHCs and MCWCs be suppose to prioritise IMCI service by maintain a dedicated corner in the outpatient department [ @card@ , @card@ ] . IMCI corner require dedicated staff ( IMCI train ) , equipment and logistic , which help operationalising outpatient service and retain the skill of the service provider . the IMCI corner also help in manage the high-volume patient flow in DHs , UHCs and MCWCs , and act as a referral link for child who be refer from UH&FWCs . contrary to the policy outline in the health sector programme , 6 % of DHs , @card@ % of UHCs , and more than @card@ % of MCWCs do not have dedicate IMCI corner . the lack of a strategic focus and programmatic investment by DGFP regard IMCI service can potentially explain the low availability of IMCI corner in MCWCs . in addition to the IMCI corner , different programme have recommend maintain various other corner like ANC corner , PNC corner , KMC corner , Scanu corner , NCD Corner , Breast Feeding corner , Via corner etc. in DHs and UHCs [ @card@ , @card@ , @card@ ] . the compete interest of various corner can , which be establish as a horizontal integration of various service , be another explanation for the gap in the availability of IMCI corner in facility with limited resource . IMCI adopt a syndromic management approach , where the service provider have to follow various clinical algorithm to classify and treat childhood illness [ @card@ ] . it require continuous in-service training and supportive supervision to retain the knowledge and skill of the service provider and ensure the quality of IMCI service [ @card@ ] . unfortunately , almost half of the survey facility do not have an IMCI trained staff and a copy of the chart booklet . the situation be particularly bad in UH&FWCs and MCWCs . although DHs and UHCs demonstrate a comparatively high level of readiness regard the availability of a service provider ever train in IMCI only around @card@ % of the DHs and approximately one-third of the UHCs have a service provider who receive IMCI training within the past @card@ month [ @card@ ] . it raise a critical concern regard the quality of IMCI service , include management of pneumonia render through the service provider without appropriate training and supervision . it reveal the apparent gap in national programme planning and implementation . the survey ( BHFS ) be conduct in @card@ , which be just after the completion of the previous National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 [ @card@ , @card@ ] . IMCI training organise by the IMCI programme in the last sector programme implementation period be not adequate to the need of the country . since @card@ , the Ministry of Health be implement the current National Health Sector Programme 2011–16 [ @card@ ] . the provision and resource allocation for IMCI training in the operation plan of the current health sector programme be also inadequate and insufficient [ @card@ , @card@ ] . moreover , in the first two year of the current sector programme implementation period ( 2017–19 ) , the IMCI programme do not organise any IMCI training for the old and newly recruit service provider . One of the core component of IMCI strategy be to improve the case-management skill of service provider through the provision of locally adapt IMCI-guidelines and through activity to promote their use . unfortunately , more than half of the survey facility do not have a copy of the chart booklet . moreover , the late version of Bangladesh adapt version of the IMCI chart booklet be base on WHO’s 2008-edition [ @card@ , @card@ ] . in @card@ , who release another version of IMCI chart booklet with major update regard pneumonia classification , treatment recommendation and referral criterion [ @card@ , @card@ ] . during the implementation period of the previous health sector programme ( 2011–16 ) and the first two year of the current health sector programme ( 2017–22 ) , the IMCI programme could not take proper initiative to update the IMCI chart booklet base on WHO’s recent recommendation as well as print and distribute them to the IMCI service delivery point in DHs , UHCs , UH&FWCs and MCWCs . this could substantially affect the safety of treatment and quality of care , particularly for pneumonia and sepsis management . IMCI be design for setting with minimum diagnostic capacity . therefore , the availability of some basic equipment and medicine must be ensure for proper clinical assessment and treatment accord to the guideline [ @card@ ] . assessment of respiratory rate be one of the most important step in IMCI-based pneumonia classification , which eventually determine the management plan , referral decision and treatment outcome [ 34–36 ] . unfortunately , two-third of the designate facility in Bangladesh do not have a functional Ari timer or watch that be able to record time in second . moreover , around half of the facility do not have an appropriate weigh scale which be important for prescribe medicine ( include antibiotic of pneumonia management ) with appropriate dosage [ @card@ ] . the majority of these essential equipment be not costly and be readily available in the local market . therefore , the observed gap in their availability reflect the apparent lack of effective programme planning , coordination and monitoring . the IMCI-based pneumonia management require the availability of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin as the first-line treatment for severe pneumonia and possible serious bacterial infection of young infant [ @card@ , @card@ ] . for more severe case , the availability of both amoxicillin and gentamicin together be essential for prereferral treatment and outpatient-based management ( when applicable ) [ @card@ ] . although the availability of oral amoxicillin be reasonably high among all type of facility , there be substantial gap regard the availability of injectable gentamicin . such critical gap in readiness regard the first-line antibiotic essentially reduce the level of effective coverage , may compromise the level of adherence to guideline and potentially result in avertable pneumonia-related death [ @card@ ] . besides the availability of the IMCI medicine , the choice of antibiotic recommendation by IMCI service provider may be influence by external factor . several study conduct in Bangladesh report that there be substantial gap regard health care provider ' adherence to guideline since many of them prefer high general antibiotic over the first-line recommended antiiotics [ 41–44 ] . documentation be one of the most important part of IMCI service . the IMCI service register be design to capture essential detail on clinical assessment , disease classification , treatment , and referral decision . it act as a job aid to assist the provider in adhere to the guideline and prepare monthly report efficiently [ @card@ ] . register be also link to the overall monitoring and supervision framework lay out for IMCI service , as well as the overall accountability structure [ @card@ , @card@ ] . although register be almost universally available in DHs and UHCs , one-third of UH&FWCs and MCWCs do not have them , accord to our analysis . the lack of availability of IMCI register also raise question regard the validity of datum in monthly report , which be the basis of effective programme plan and monitor for health manager . base on the multi-country evaluation of IMCI , which run from @card@ to @card@ , who release a position paper with a strong recommendation for health system strengthen by ensure the availability of skilled health worker , essential medicine , and supply as a comprehensive package in all IMCI service delivery point [ @card@ ] . the lack of comprehensive readiness , include essential equipment , drug and logistic adversely affect the performance of the IMCI service provider and result in the poor quality of care [ @card@ , @card@ ] . a global survey conduct by who find that the country with a comprehensive implementation status of IMCI be @card@ time be more likely to achieve MDG-4 target than other country who could not adopt a comprehensive approach [ @card@ ] . it be imperative to ensure comprehensive readiness of facility for provide IMCI service , include pneumonia management , by learn lesson from this global evidence . we report substantial gap regard the overall readiness of public facility in Bangladesh pertain to pneumonia management . the readiness of private facility regard IMCI service be equally poor in Bangladesh [ @card@ ] . Less than 1 % of the private facility be identify to be ready for provide child curative service . only @card@ % of private facility have an IMCI trained staff . without address these gap , it will not be possible to adhere to the who quality of care standard relate to the provision of care and experience of care [ @card@ ] . the lack of comprehensive readiness , include essential equipment , drug and logistic adversely affect the performance of the IMCI service provider and result in the poor quality of care [ @card@ , @card@ ] . the readiness be much bad in lower-level facility and facility locate in rural area . the low level facility ( UH&FWCs ) be mostly locate in rural area and serve as the first point of contact for the poor and more disadvantaged section of the population . thus , the low level of overall readiness in these facility further contribute to the existing inequity in access to and utilisation of appropriate health service in Bangladesh and other low- and middle-income country [ 2 , 49–51 ] . accord to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2017–18 , only @card@ % of the under 5 child with symptom of acute respiratory infection seek care from public health facility [ @card@ ] . the poor level of readiness of public facility may explain the low care-seeking practice from public health facility . Hypoxaemia be common among child with pneumonia and be one of the strong predictor of mortality due to acute low respiratory infection [ 53–55 ] . integration of SpO2 assessment in exist IMCI service can significantly improve the accuracy of hypoxemia assessment and increase the validity ( accuracy ) of pneumonia classification ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in response to the need and global evidence , who recommend measure SpO2 in routine IMCI service ( @card@ , @card@ ) . in addition , oxygen security be a vital concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . the government of Bangladesh adopt the who recommendation and decide to introduce pulse oximetry in IMCI service for SpO2 assessment [ @card@ ] . although the survey predate the government of Bangladesh’s policy adoption regard SpO2 assessment in IMCI service , it be helpful to understand the baseline situation of the country in this regard . Less than one-tenth of the facility have pulse oximetry . the availability of pulse oximetry be not optimal even in referral hospital as less than one-third of the DHs and one-fifth of the UHCs have readiness in this regard . this be similar to the status of many other low- and middle country with limited resource [ @card@ ] . To achieve the universal availability of pulse oximetry in all IMCI service contact point , the government of Bangladesh need to prioritise its procurement and efficiently manage its distribution . in addition to ensure the availability of pulse oximetry , it be equally important to ensure the availability of oxygen in referral hospital to aggressively correct and manage hypoxaemia [ @card@ , @card@ ] . unfortunately , one-third of the DHs and one-fourth of the UHCs do not have a reliable oxygen source which be essential for manage child with hypoxaemia . effective oxygen therapy require not only prompt and accurate detection of hypoxaemia but also appropriate administration of oxygen , combine with good clinical evaluation and management of the underlie condition . Bangladesh can learn from other low- and middle-income country that have strategically invest in oxygen security in referral hospital and effectively reduce the burden of mortality due to pneumonia [ @card@ , @card@ ] . experience from four decade of ‘ oxygen project ' show that effective improvement of oxygen system in low-resource setting be possible but be complex and require context-specific technical , clinical , and managerial solution [ @card@ ] . it be important to discuss some of the strength and limitation of this study . BHFS-2017 be conduct with a nationally representative sample allow us to generate specific estimate by facility type , location and division . moreover , the datum collection tool use in BHFS-2017 be validate and adapt to the national context through expert consultation . the survey present a snapshot of the service availability and readiness of the survey facility since it only consider the availability of service and item on the day of the visit . information regard service availability be base on the self-reported status of the facility . regard readiness , the datum collector physically verify the availability of required and essential item and assess their functionality where applicable . although there be no globally validate criterion for assess the service availability and readiness relate to pneumonia management , we go through an expert consultation process under the leadership of IMCI programme in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to develop the service availability and readiness criterion for Bangladesh . the expert identify the list of required and essential item as well as the score system base on consensus and under the leadership of the national IMCI programme . although the list and the score system be not validate externally , they reflect the national programme priority . lastly , we acknowledge that the gap in service availability and readiness may be result from broad health system build block issue such as health financing and governance . the availability of datum do not allow us to explore and present such root cause , which need to be explore through future research in this field . our study finding report low to moderate level of readiness for provide IMCI-based pneumonia management in public health facility in Bangladesh . the readiness be significantly poor among rural and lower-level facility . achieve the ambitious target of avert all preventable pneumonia-related mortality by @card@ will require effective coverage of pneumonia management with appropriate quality of care from the government and support from global level partner . ensure the service availability and readiness of health facility be the first step towards promote effective coverage and be integral to WHO’s quality of care framework . there be substantial gap in the availability of IMCI service and readiness of essential item require for pneumonia management in public health facility in Bangladesh . the situation be significantly bad in the low level and rural facility . Bangladesh should make substantial effort to improve programme planning , implementation , and monitor to address these critical gap to ensure good provision of care for child suffer from pneumonia . moreover , as IMCI have be scale up in Bangladesh , there be a need for research on improve delivery strategy and overcome barrier to implementation .   Covid-19 : a test for our humanity the Covid-19 pandemic be not a war zone of combat and compete interest , but a ‘ test of our humanity ' , as the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier say in his television speech on @card@ April @card@ . this be as time of carefully address ethical principle that both guide and challenge act and policy , to investigate how these principle contribute to uphold humanity , and how they inform us about unsolvable dilemma . these be time we have to act even though we might make the wrong decision . part of test our humanity be prepare ourselves to face the wrong decision that be make in time of uncertainty . there seem to be confusion about what contribute to humanity . all over the world , group claim that their humanity be under pressure because their right to freedom be restrict . but , be it the loss of some liberty that threaten humanity , or be it a sign of humanity that some take burden to protect other ? for some , herd immunity be the magic word to reach a most humane strategy : the idea that if only enough people fall ill to Covid-19 and recover , base on their antibody the disease can spread anymore . yet , to reach herd immunity through a population-wide experienced disease , rather than vaccination , also mean , to at least accept that some people will not fully recover from Covid-19 or even die . other argue that to prepare our health care facility be a sign of humanity . in the heat of the crisis , image of quickly erect hospital capture an undercurrent of implicit bias towards an idea that ‘ right to healthcare ' can be narrow to ‘ a right to ICU care ' . question about access to scarce good like protective clothing get a different understanding when heart-breaking appeal to our humanity from staff of care- and nursing home draw attention to question about who’s protect whom ( e. g. supply of protective clothing ) and to what end ( health vs. family value ) ? we contend that we need a moral language that offer conceptual clarity and do not shy away from normative guidance in this ‘ test of humanity ' . it be necessary to identify ethical principle and rule that inform what claim be justify and consequently need to be act upon . we propose the use of seven ethical principle that , in no particular hierarchical order , shed light on the problem at hand . these principle structure the question we face and offer a framework of what at least should be address when try to reach decision defensible and transparent decision . the principle that play a role in analyse the ethic of Covid-19 be population health maximization , justice , autonomy , harm avoidance ( ‘ harm principle ' ) , public trust , solidarity and reciprocity and protection of the vulnerable . these principle , base on the six principle in Schröder-Bäck et al . @card@ with the addition of the vulnerability principle be briefly explain in table 1 . Covid-19 have affect everybody’s life but not in equal way . in many European country resident in long-term care facility ( LTCF ) be affect in various way : fail report , limited testing , shortage of protective measure , infectious staff , lack of training and lock down for visitors.2 the principle of population health maximization demand monitor system that include the entire population , i. e. , include resident in LTCF . Justice require non-discrimination : where you reside should not matter , and age be not a valid argument as such . the vulnerability principle ask for specific identification of who be vulnerable to what3 : not all elderly people be equally vulnerable ( high socioeconomic-status still offer good protection ) and vulnerability can be enhance by the decision other people make . consequently , responsibility need to be specify , e. g. , ‘ outbreak management team ' have to give dedicated specialist the power to act upon the specific identify vulnerability . have these dedicated specialists—with a keen eye for the patient and public engagement4—contribute to trustworthy policy . once the argument result from these principle be arrange , the question result from the principle of solidarity and reciprocity can be address : how much burden can be expect from different group and who ought to be give some leeway ? finally , give the analysis base on the previous principle , the public need to be inform to enable their autonomous decision-making about , e. g. , support or protest the isolation of people in LTCF . finally , we want to call upon the public health community not to shy away from openly discuss the moral distress.5 the Covid-19 pandemic cause . we need to collect the storey about the situation where member of the public health community be hinder in do what be the ethically appropriate action due to circumstance beyond their control , for example , institutionalize impediment . share these storey be necessary first of all to avoid discouragement on both an individual and organizational level . secondly , it create insight into what the public health community deem as ‘ ethically appropriate action ' . thirdly , these situation of moral distress be a treasure trove for an evaluation of where and when system ‘ test our humanity ' . conflict of interest : none declare .   family in the time of the pandemic : breakdown or Breakthrough ? COVID‐19 have impact economic , educational , employment , financial , mental and physical health , social , spiritual , and many other developmental aspect of family and community , certainly in way that we be uncomfortably unfamiliar with . social distancing and lockdown measure have result in force proximity among family member and have disconnect individual from their support network ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ; Van Bavel et al . , @card@ ) . To compound the situation further , pre‐existing and new macro‐system development such as political and social movement and natural disaster continue to interplay with this pandemic in many part of the world . One such example be the US presidential election and the United States ' economic war with China , which have repercussion on different front , include socioeconomic and political context . moreover , the impact of the pandemic and the challenge of the macro system intersect with stressful condition and unfair bias arise from racism , sexism , poverty , and other form of oppression . hence , vulnerable group , such as people of a certain age , economic status , or race be more adversely affect during a try time like this ( Twigg , @card@ ) . conversely , it be not difficult to imagine how inequality spread COVID‐19 ( Ahmed , Ahmed , Pissarides , & Stiglitz , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . there be a plethora of contemporary systemic literature that focus on the COVID‐19 pandemic as the source of multiple stress affect global and mental health for family , include loss of life , loss of social and physical contact , loss of employment and financial security , loss of hope and dream , and loss of normalcy ( see , e. g. , Walsh , @card@ ) . moreover , anxiety , depression , fear , grief , trauma , difficulty in adaptation ( e. g. , sleep and eating pattern ) , and relationship conflict be some of the bio‐psycho‐social challenge face individual and their family during the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Amorin‐Woods et al . , @card@ ; Falicov , Nino , & D’urso , @card@ ; Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . this situation be further worsen by conflicting public information ( see Gunthe et al . ( @card@ ) for a review ) , as well as the uncertainty that family may experience either directly or indirectly ( Lee , @card@ ; Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . all of these condition and stressors could further exacerbate one another ( Walsh , @card@ ) . when we be invite to contribute to this special issue of the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Family therapy , we think it provide a valuable opportunity to reflect on our clinical practice over the course of this extraordinary year . during this time , there have be a burgeon literature about the impact\n",
            "of COVID‐19 on family and couple relationship . by bring together some aspect of the literature with our clinical practice , our specific goal be to examine the unique challenge and opportunity of COVID‐19 for family at different life developmental stage , as well as the challenge and opportunity for systemic therapist as they venture into unfamiliar territory beyond the comfort of their physical therapy room , without a clear map , when they practice online ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ) . we will start with a composite case example of the Smith family which be base , loosely , on the first author 's clinical practice in London . however , we believe that the case capture some of the feature and dilemma that multigenerational family – all over the world – be face during these unprecedented time . we will use the case example to illustrate key systemic theoretical idea that we have be draw on in our practice , link up the idea with the current systemic literature , describe the process of work with the Smith family , and end by outline the clinical implication , challenge , and opportunity for family and therapist . John and Siew be an intercultural , professional couple in their 40s . they have two child – Lian ( @card@ ) and Mark ( @card@ ) . Siew’s 78‐year‐old mother , who be originally from China , live with the family . Siew suffer from diabetes and develop COVID‐19 . she be extremely ill but manage to survive . since then , she have be suffer from ‘ Long COVID ' ( Venkatesan , @card@ ) . John and the child have be shield Siew and her mother . they have not be able to leave the house and the child have be school online . Lian be worry about her A‐level result and whether she will be able to attend university . as she be at home , she be the main carer for her mother , grandmother , and young brother . Mark be miss his friend and spend excessive time play video game . Siew’s mother miss her sibling and friend back in China . she be extremely upset by the racism that their family face because of their Chinese origin . Mark , who look more Chinese than his sister , be often the subject of racial harassment online . John find the pressure within the family and in his work situation impossible to manage . he turn to misuse alcohol . conflict erupt between the couple , and have escalate into intimate partner violence . in work with the Smith family , we draw on Mason’s ( @card@ ) classic and seminal text and its subsequent revision ( @card@ ) on safe uncertainty . there be uncertainty at every level for the Smith family , as even the act of leave the house for any one of the family member be deem unsafe . food delivery and any package come into the house need to be carefully disinfect ; fear of contamination lead to possible transmission of COVID‐19 be an ongoing concern . at another level , there be chronic uncertainty about future event , for example , whether Lian would be able to fulfill her cherished dream of go to university , or whether John’s employment would continue . within this domain of unsafe uncertainty , family member position could become polarise . Siew and her mother represent a position of be careful to the point of be phobic , whereas John be position as be careless about hygiene and social distancing . the polarise position seem to reflect discourse in society ( and even nation ) in their way of respond to this pandemic . within the systemic literature it be note that perhaps the big challenge of work with individual , couple , and family during COVID‐19 be that of uncertainty ( Lee , @card@ ; Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . Transmission of COVID‐19 be invisible . infected individual can be asymptomatic and yet contagious . even when vaccine become available , the way COVID‐19 may continue in different part of the world and its implication be unknown . the impact of these uncertainty on people 's health and psychosocial well‐being be beyond the experience of most . moreover , these uncertainty further impact the essential service and system that family depend on , such as business , education , employment , financial , housing , medical , social care and security , transport , travel , and other system . disconnection from workplace , school , medical and public service , and social service for family member with special need generate further complication and uncertainty for many family ( Mclintosh , @card@ ) . Walsh ( @card@ ) aptly describe this period as ‘ shatter assumption ' ( page @card@ ) , where the taken‐for‐granted belief and expectation about our life and our connection to our world no longer hold . the context of unsafe uncertainty seem recursively link to unsafe or dangerous family and couple interaction . the escalation of family and couple violence may be particularly difficult for family who may not have access to resource , such as those who live in small space . during the pandemic , home may become a hothouse of interaction during a time when there be limited possibility for escape into the outside world ( Lebow , @card@ ; Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . family relationship may become tense due to force proximity as a result of quarantine measure , especially for those who live in close quarter . sadly , datum around the world , include from China , France , Brazil , and Italy , report up to a @card@ % increase in incident of domestic violence during the pandemic ( Campbell , @card@ ) . many of these incident may be due to ‘ situational couple violence , ' in which conflict that usually do not involve physical violence have escalate due to added stress and unrelenting proximity ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ; University of Nevada , @card@ ) . moreover , the need to quarantine with partner and family member despite there be conflict , or even violence , before the pandemic can be even more challenging . family boundary become more diffuse , both physically and psychologically , and relationship conflict become more frequent and intense , because they be no longer mitigate by daily activity such as go to work and school . notably , there be little documentation about child abuse , parent abuse , and even poly‐victimisation ( Chan , @card@ ) , that be , more than one type of abuse happen within the family . safety be paramount when work with different type of family during the COVID‐19 pandemic . Stanley and Markman ( @card@ ) poignantly articulate four type of safety in order for relationship to thrive : physical , emotional , commitment , and community . notably , in family that be experience abuse , violence , or divorce there may be a strong possibility of either physical or emotional danger for family member ( Lebow , @card@ ; Vetere , @card@ ) . Prior to the pandemic , visit family member or neighbour , and attend religious gathering be often important psychosocial protective factor . during the pandemic , the need to maintain social distance curtail protective in‐person family and community connection . this may place increase stress on the internal dynamics of couple and family relationship at home as their community connection shrink . increase use of electronic or other emerge way to connect help many couple to maintain their network and social capital ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . conversely , increase use of online activity may also create tension between parent and their child ( Lin , @card@ ) . in the Smith family , during the first lockdown period , Siew accuse John of ‘ want to kill her ' by not disinfect their food adequately , lead to a violent argument between the two . argument would also break out between John and Mark over his excessive gaming , which make him rude and defiant . How can we as clinician help couple and family negotiate these struggle so that they can take sensible precaution while embrace uncertainty ? Later in this article , we will outline the way in which we work in order to shift the Smith family to a place of safe uncertainty . the pandemic have affect family at every stage of the developmental life cycle , from infancy to death . further , ritual that mark the transition from one family life‐cycle stage to another may be disrupt . as a result of pandemic social distancing measure , there be substantial disruption of life plan and ritual such as birthday , wedding , religious holiday , recreational activity , and funeral ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . this may have a formidable impact on family process . for instance , family whose member die while hospitalise be not able to be at their deathbed , and in many case be unable to follow ritual prescribe by their religion ( Frayer , Estrin , & Arraf , @card@ ) . this may be particularly pronounce for migrant family , who would not be able to travel back ‘ home ' to grieve or mourn the loss of their kin . COVID‐19 have additional special meaning for different type of family . for example , for family contemplate divorce , divorce , or carry out post‐divorce arrangement , COVID‐19 may potentiate the stress and challenge involve ( Lebow , @card@ ) . during lockdown , acrimony and distance readily increase for family that be already experience tension , and the legal system be either not open or proceed with a major backlog of case that can make this often uncertain and turbulent process even more challenge ( Lebow , @card@ ) . in the case of the Smith family , Lian could not make the transition to the leave home stage of the family life cycle as she be not sure whether she could go to university . her grandmother be in a state of constant grief , anxiety , and preemptive grief , have learn of the death of two close relative back in China . the Social GRRRAAACCEEEESS ( Burnham , @card@ ) be a mnemonic that have help family and systemic psychotherapist keep in mind the intersect aspect of social difference . the GRRAAACCEEEESS currently stand for Gender , Geography , Race , Religion , Age , Ability , Appearance , Class , Culture , ethnicity , Education , Employment , Sexuality , sexual orientation , and Spirituality . COVID‐19 have have a differential impact on different nation and different group in society . vulnerable group , such as racial and ethnic minority , the poor and the old , and those who have have physical and mental challenge before or during the pandemic , have be most hard hit ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . for example , many be in job that put them at risk of be infect , unlike those who have a buffer of saving , or pay leave , or who could work from home . small child may show anxious cling or need constant contact while adolescent may distance ( Walsh , @card@ ) . many family with special need child ( e. g. , autism , cerebral palsy , intellectual disability ) or adult ( e. g. , serious mental disorder , acquire brain injury ) be adapt to the COVID‐19 without the usual specialise supportive and educational service ( Rolland , @card@ ) . this often mean that family member , particularly female family member , may be overburden ( United Nations , @card@ ) . the Social GRRAAACCCEEESS play out within the Smith family , at many level . Siew , be from a minority ethnic background and with underlie health difficulty , be at increase risk for COVID‐19 . further , Siew’s mother’s age make her even more vulnerable . Siew 's and the children’s Chinese origin put them at risk for be discriminate against , especially at a time when there be considerable ‘ othering ' in the wide sociopolitical context . work with the Smith family start in March @card@ ( coincide with the first lockdown in London ) and be ongoing . it have be challenging and difficult , and working online have add to the complexity . I ( RS ) have work with different subsystem in the family and have bring the whole family together during some of the online session . in an early session with the parent , John and Siew be able to voice their anxiety – about COVID‐19 , about the child , about Siew’s mother , and about work and the future . use Tomm’s ( 1987a , 1987b , @card@ , @card@ ) technique of interview the internalise other , I help them both to appreciate the other’s position . John be able to understand Siew’s preoccupation with hygiene and contamination and Siew be able to empathise with the myriad pressure to which John be subject . draw on Vetere’s ( @card@ ) work , I coach John in how to negotiate space apart from the family when he be in a state of arousal and need to calm down . Siew be able to express her need for dependency whilst be able to allow John to take space away from her , in order to calm down . a turn point come in June @card@ , when John think that Siew be go to die of COVID‐19 , and realise how much she mean to him . redistribute role and responsibility within the family free Lian from her position of have to take on the role of the main carer . Siew learn how to simplify household task and expectation and be able to rely on her mother to help more in the house . I mediate between the adult and the young people to put in place a contract with specific time for Mark to be allow to play video game , conditional on his exercise every day outside the house and complete academic task and household chore . I address the wide context of racism for the family , and John be able to take on a stance of protect his family from racism . the child be teach how to defend themselves , and each other , from racial abuse by their peer group . it be more difficult for the family to talk about their experience of racism from within . be there time , in the current context , when the child feel ashamed of their Chinese heritage ? How be the political and economic struggle between China and the West play out in the relationship between John and Siew ? it be vital to create a safe space where these difficult conversation could be have . grandmother and parent be encourage to recount family of origin script when cope with adversity in their own family history ( Mason , @card@ ) . John be able to think about his parent ' storey from the Second World War and Siew’s mother be able to draw on her own experience from Communist China . the storey be use to strengthen resilience within the family . as the work progress , the family be able to create their own ritual around spend meaningful family time together . John put in boundary between work life and home life , and Siew and her mother engage in Zoom conversation and event with family in China and all over the world . the violence between the couple abate . they begin to enjoy the moment ; keep themselves and their family safe , despite the flux in the political context around them – hence operate from a place of safe uncertainty ( Mason , @card@ , @card@ ) . the Smith family be currently look forward to Chinese New year , to the prospect of the vaccination , and to the arrival of spring ! we hope that in describe the process of the work with the Smith family , we have be able to highlight the opportunity the pandemic have afford family . on the one hand , home confinement can easily create condition for conflict or estrangement as household member readjust work , school , and recreational activity ; face possible contagion and financial strain ; and spend virtually all of their time together in limited physical space . on the other hand , such proximity might also create opportunity for increase closeness , communal problem solve , and deep personal relationship , depend on certain condition ; conjugal relation during lockdown appear to be more harmonious when there be no child in the household ( Gunther‐Bel et al . , @card@ ) . Falicov et al . ( @card@ ) find that family that be under‐resourced can be more adaptive in cope with the pandemic as they be use to endure different challenge in life relate to poverty , crowd , and confinement problem , compare to well‐resourced family . this be in keep with Mason’s ( @card@ ) question of family of origin script in cope with adversity and help family to make connection between these transgenerational storey and the current context . reinvent old ritual or create new routine through the use of technology ( Imber‐Black , @card@ ) be an opportunity for family to come together through creative and concerted effort . these ritual may be relate to family tradition ( e. g. , spring holiday ) , or they may be spiritual or developmental ( e. g. , graduation , birthday , and death ) . for example , visit grandparent regularly or celebrate their birthday via Zoom , or clap hand to pay tribute to frontline health worker on a nightly basis , or even national day celebration online , be shine example of old ritual reinvent and new one that have add mean to individual , family , and even community during this challenging time . notably , these ritual require individual and family to come together to plan and execute . COVID‐19 have give family opportunity to assess whether their relationship and lifestyle before the pandemic be ‘ normal ' , for example , the amount of time spend together and time spend do different thing . it have also provide a chance for family to reconsider the ratio of togetherness and autonomy go forward ( Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ) . in think more deeply about the ‘ old normal ' and the ‘ New Normal ' we realise that many aspect of our pre‐COVID life that be normalise need to be change for the well . as we expand our vision beyond our personal struggle , we see a need for broad systemic change with more urgency ( Walsh , @card@ , page @card@ ) . the pandemic have also create unique challenge and opportunity for us as therapist . when consider uncertainty and safety , practitioner need to be cognisant of the intersectionality of the COVID‐19 pandemic and large context before , during , and even after the pandemic ( Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ; Sim , @card@ ) . these include at least the cultural , economic , historical , political , and social factor that may compound the impact of the pandemic . therapist need to consider adequately how macrosystemic issue be intrinsically interweave with the experience of individual and family during COVID‐19 ( Rolland , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ; Watson et al . , @card@ ) . for example , COVID‐19 hit the United Kingdom when it be contend with the uncertainty of Brexit , while Hong Kong be still in the midst of the social movement that bring it to the attention of the world . during the pandemic , the economic war between the United States and China have probably intensify the economic pressure of family beyond these two economic power house . meanwhile , the Black Lives Matter movement intensify racial relation all over the world , which correspond with the racism direct towards Asian when COVID‐19 initially begin in different country ( Sim , @card@ ; Watson et al . , @card@ ) . natural disaster do not stop before or during the pandemic and surely will not stop after , and some family in different part of the world have to deal with both natural disaster and the pandemic . therefore , therapist need to appreciate that while family cope with the pervasive impact of COVID‐19 on a day‐to‐day basis in relation to education , financial , health , and other issue , they may already be deal with pre‐existing illness or disability or racial and socioeconomic disparity ( Rolland , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ) . such a predicament become much bad if at least one family member have be infect by COVID‐19 . in addition , it would be pertinent for therapist to appreciate the issue with which famile be contend that be compound by large context , such as the possible polarisation of couple and family member due to social movement during the pandemic ( Sahebi , @card@ ) . Watson et al . ( @card@ , page @card@ ) vehemently state : … unless we pay close attention to the impact of racism , classism , colonization , environmental injustice , and collective trauma during this pandemic crisis now and for many year after , as family therapist we would also be perpetuate the cycle of discrimination . furthermore , different family member , different family , and different section of society , particularly low income and minority family , may experience the current situation differently and this be likely to lead to factionalism and polarise position rather than a communal ethic of work together ( Rivett , @card@ ; Rolland , @card@ ) . during this pandemic , most therapy move online . One of the way in which this pandemic have open up new opportunity be that more individual , couple , and family have be force to become comfortable with virtual contact and telehealth system ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ; Walsh , @card@ ) . notably , the practice of teletherapy ( also refer to as telehealth , telemental health , telemedicine , telepsychology , or telepsychiatry ) be neither new nor uncommon , and be grow before the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . in view of its increase use , counsel and psychotherapy association around the world begin provide guideline for online practice ( e. g. , American Psychological Association , @card@ , @card@ ; British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy , @card@ ) . in the field of couple and family therapy , there be already clear guideline develop before COVID‐19 take the field by surprise ( AAMFTS , @card@ ; Blumer et al . , @card@ ; Shaw , @card@ ) . One of the most commonly discuss challenge of teletherapy relate to confidentiality and the loss of immediate physical presence , which exclude non‐verbal communication , which therapist spend year learn to discern and utilise ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ) . the debate about teletherapy , though ongoing , need to develop further . for instance , there may be a need to scrutinise relevant issue relate to teletherapy such as its effectiveness , or identify the commonality and idiosyncratic issue of teletherapy and conduct therapy in a room . Could there be a good blend between two or more form of therapy on‐ and offline , at which stage , and with whom ? moreover , debate and issue relate to develop relevant systemic couple and family teletherapy curriculum , core competence , supervision , and evaluation be challenge the field must take on urgently . What about family who may not have access to the Internet ? there be a range of issue link to ‘ telesupervision ' ( Sahebi , @card@ ) during COVID‐19 , such as structural change and technological adaptation of supervision , new boundary and supervisory role , the supervisory alliance , and both the supervisor ' and supervisees ' vulnerability in the face of COVID‐19 , to name a few . a group of systemic family therapist and their intern believe that , while online supervision be novel and not without advantage , ‘ there be no replacement for direct , in‐person interaction , and continue to regard the in‐person live supervision practicum as our preferred way of conduct therapy and supervision ' ( Nathan et al . , @card@ , page @card@ ) . there be an increase evidence base for telehealth psychology and psychotherapy for different population and mental health issue include veteran and civilian PTSD , obesity management , parent , and adolescent obsessive compulsive disorder ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . online application of couple and family therapy have also be find recently ( see Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ for a review ) . there be many advantage to telehealth psychotherapy service . these include : improve availability of service in rural and remote area , and for client group experience difficulty leave the home ( e. g. , client with agoraphobia , stigmatise group , family of child with traumatic brain injury , etc. ) ; enhance capacity for client to choose a clinician with specific expertise ; reduce time wait for an appointment ; less time off work to attend the appointment ; and increase flexibility in appointment time and location ( Hale & Brennan , @card@ ) . with regard to the challenge associate with use technology , one of the major challenge that need to be urgently resolve be that some family do not have access to the Internet or have limit capability in use the Internet and related application . many of these family may also be experience dire situation relate to violence , mental health , racism , and so on ( Sim , @card@ ) . this may require couple and family therapist to innovatively use other mean that be safe , legitimate , and culturally sensitive , such as promote other support that be available within the family and the community ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . more importantly , in deal with this ‘ wicked problem ' that have leave the world with no immediate or ultimate solution ( Rittel & Webber , @card@ ) , this call for couple and family therapist to work closely with other professional collaboratively and be willing to learn and listen ( Falicov et al . , @card@ ) . as Dickerson ( @card@ , page @card@ ) suggest , therapist should look out for opportunity : by utilize our experience and expertise as system thinker , we can , in a disciplined way , improvise a response to the situation . we need to be nimble , able to think outside the box , and ready for the unexpected and unpredictable . these be difficult and challenging contextual , legal , and professional issue that may affect different therapy model and the place we work and live in differently . therapist must not rush , as speed have no speed . perhaps the beautiful Latin proverb ‘ Festina Lente ' and the Greek ‘ Σπεῡδε Βραδέως , ' which mean ‘ hasten slowly , ' may bring to bear the consideration of care as we work on these challenge move forward . but surely these challenge present us with many opportunity in the field . a fundamental systemic principle be that change in context impose new constraint and lift other ( Pinsof et al . , @card@ ) . conduct couple and family therapy online be a huge change in context for both the family and the therapist , and bring both challenge and opportunity . whilst couple and family therapist attempt to make a difference for family , they too may be face compete demand in work from home , include rapid role shift and manage distraction , and may be struggle with the same fear and constraint as the individual and family they be attempt to help ( Burgoyne & Cohn , @card@ ; Fraenkel & Cho , @card@ ; Sahebi , @card@ ) . the need for therapist to care for themselves be essential , especially if they increasingly have to work online , where the boundary between real life and the online world become less define . on a more pragmatic level , in maintain interpersonal relationship Falicov et al . ( @card@ ) suggest that therapist replace physical expression of affection with care word during COVID‐19 , where appropriate . these include ‘ I hope you and yours stay healthy and safe , ' or ‘ I hope you all don’t worry too much , ' or even ‘ I send hug to all of you . ' a statement from a therapist to client such as ‘ know that you can always call on me ' may have more poignant implication during uncertain time . Fraenkel and Cho ( @card@ ) believe that therapist must go beyond traditional psychotherapeutic intervention to meet the challenge of this pandemic . Imber‐Black ( @card@ ) poignantly observe that ritual bend and do not break during COVID‐19 , and suggest therapist work with couple and family in develop simple new ritual to stay connect . in a similar vein , Walsh ( @card@ ) suggest therapist innovatively help family to increase their resilience by focus on the powerful influence of family belief system in ‘ bounce forward ' ( page @card@ ) . use a multisystemic framework with due consideration of life course development and multigenerational issue , Rolland ( @card@ ) suggest therapist and health‐care clinician provide timely family‐oriented consultation and psychoeducation , while attend to their own self‐care . Watson et al . ( @card@ ) invite family therapist to think globally about individual issue at large and suggest a just‐based framework for family therapist to address challenge relate to health inequity , economic insecurity , environmental injustice , and collective trauma . in her muse from a Zen perspective , Lee ( @card@ ) seem convince that if people be less certain about their claim in their struggle with relationship problem during the pandemic , they may realise that what they be do be not to their benefit , thereby open up new room for change . and when feeling stick in therapy , Lee simply suggest : ‘ let us go and drink some tea ! ' ( page @card@ ) . we be impress with the current literature publish within a short time . but we be certain there will be more literature as the COVID‐19 pandemic continue to play out and as we continue to find different way to cope with it . in try time such as these , there need to be new direction and solution in family therapy and family science , particularly since the context for family functioning , practice , and research have change drastically during the COVID‐19 pandemic ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ) . family therapist and researcher have already start make timely effort to examine what can be do in practice and research , such as the development of new scale ( e. g. , Behar‐Zusman et al . , @card@ ) or new way of conduct family research rigorously during COVID‐19 when safety be an issue among a plethora of challenge ( Brock & Laifer , @card@ ) . however , these be early day for understand the longstanding impact of COVID‐19 on individual , couple , family , group , community , country , and the world . more research and critical reflection be need as the pandemic unravel and hit country in wave ; it be highly likely that COVID‐19 will change the way we do thing in the future , although some be more predictable than other ( Stanley & Markman , @card@ ) . at the same time , the context will continue to evolve . we must prepare to break through another new coronavirus or other situation that will call for us to work closely together .   decrease prealbumin level be associate with increase risk of mortality in hospitalize elderly patient with COVID-19 the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) epidemic be cause by an infection with a novel coronavirus , officially name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-COV-2)1 . the infection spread rapidly on all continent and be declare a pandemic by the World Health Organization . as of April @card@ , @card@ , @card@ document case be report worldwide , and @card@ patient have die . as there be currently no specific treatment and medication against the new virus , it be crucial to identify risk factor of severe prognosis . old patient have poor prognostic factor and be more likely to experience critical disease2 , 3 . base on recent statistical datum of China , among patient who be @card@ year and old , the mortality rate be @card@ % , which be significantly high than that of young patient at @card@ . the proportion of death over @card@ year old account for @card@ % of the total death in the national wide , which implicate age people be more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-25 . till present there be rare report in literature focus on the risk factor for poor outcome of the elderly patient with COVID-19 . Serum prealbumin , know as transthyretin , its level may be lower not only by malnutrition , but also by inflammation and aging6 , 7 . compare to albumin , prealbumin have a short half-life , a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis , and predictable catabolic rate ; hence , it may be a more sensitive indicator8 . however , whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalize COVID-19 elderly patient need to be further elucidate . the present study aim to describe the clinical characteristic and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in-hospital mortality , which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality . we design this study as a retrospective cohort study design . the elderly patient with COVID-19 who be admit to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January @card@ to February @card@ , @card@ be consecutively include . this study be approve by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital ( Approval Number : TJ-IRB20200328 ) , and be comply with the Declaration of Helsinki . the datum be anonymous and the study be observational , so the informed consent be not gather . a flow-diagram illustrate patient selection be describe in Figure 1 . inclusion criterion include elderly patient ( ≥ @card@ year old ) diagnose with COVID-19 infection . a total of @card@ participant have be obtain . patient have missing baseline or outcome datum , die on admission or be transfer to other designate hospital during hospitalization be exclude . there be @card@ patient be include in the final analysis . Data collection of participant be perform use hospital electronic medical record system . information include medical history , demographic datum , physical examination , and hematological , biochemical , radiological and microbiological evaluation result be review . the data collection form be review independently by 2 researcher ( CL and LYY ) . blood examination be assess at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital follow standard operative procedure . the routine blood test be analyze use Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer ( Sysmex , Kobe , Japan ) . the Cobas C8000 ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) be use to measure the biochemical parameter . coagulation test be detect by STA-R Max coagulation analyzer ( Diagnostica Stago , Saint-Denis , France ) . throat swab sample be collect and be test for SARS-CoV-2 with commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) kit from DAAN Gene ( Guangzhou , China)9 . the diagnostic criterion and all clinical procedure in this study follow “ diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus ( Trial version 1 to 7 ) promulgate by the National Health and Health Commission of China . summary statistic of baseline characteristic of all patient and stratification by prealbumin tertiles be express as frequency and proportion for categorical variable , mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) ( Gaussian distribution ) or median ( range ) ( skewed distribution ) for continuous variable , and as percentage for categorical variable . the difference between group be analyze use the χ2 ( categorical variable ) , One-Way ANOVA test ( normal distribution ) , or Kruskal-Whallis H test ( skewed distribution ) . we examine the relationship of the prealbumin as categorize into tertiles with the outcome of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model be use to evaluate these relationship , then unadjusted and adjusted odd ratio ( ORs ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CIs ) be calculate . model 1 be the minimally-adjusted model with only sociodemographic variable adjust . model 2 be the fully-adjusted model with covariates include age , sex , smoking status , history of hypertension , history of coronary heart disease , history of diabetes , history of chronic kidney disease , history of carcinoma , history of chronic liver disease , neutrophil , lymphocyte , prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , d-dimer , alanine transaminase , aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , C-reactive protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio . we calculate odd ratio ( ORs ) and @card@ % confidence interval ( CIs ) . the high tertile be the reference for prealbumin . we perform test for linear trend by enter the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity . To ensure the robustness of our result , we also perform stratify analysis with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratify by gender , age , hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline . generalize additive model be use to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcome ( all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ) . modeling be perform with the statistical software package R ( http : //www . R-project . org , the R Foundation ) and EmpowerStats ( http : //www . empowerstats . com , X&Y Solutions , Inc , Boston , Ma ) . P value less than @card@ ( two-sided ) be consider statistically significant . in our study , @card@ case be exclude . To avoid selection bias due to missing datum , we perform a sensitivity analysis . the result show that there be no statistical difference between miss group and non-missing group ( supplemental table 1 ) . of @card@ elderly inpatient include in the final analysis , the mean age be @card@ ( @card@ ) year , range from @card@ year to @card@ year , and most patient be male ( table 1 ) . the baseline characteristic of these include participant be list in table1 . the day of sample drawing after admission be @card@ ± @card@ day . no significant statistical difference in sex , smoking status , body weight , BMI , comorbidity ( hypertension , coronary heart disease , chronic kidney disease , cerebral vascular disease , carcinoma , chronic liver disease ) , symptom ( fever , cough , headache , diarrhea and myalgia/fatigue at admission ) be detect across different group of prealbumin ( tertile ) . when compare with subject in the high tertile , those in the low tertile be old , more likely to have diabetes medical history , with high Neutrophil count , low lymphocyte count , bad coagulation function and liver function . a total of @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient require mechanical ventilation , @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient admit to intensive care unit and @card@ ( @card@ % ) patient die during hospitalization . the incidence of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation be significantly decrease across prealbumin tertiles ( all-cause death , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 ; ICU admission , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 , mechanical ventilation , @card@ % vs. @card@ % vs. @card@ % for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3 , respectively ) . To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome , we construct three model use univariate and multivariate logistic regression model ( table 2 ) . in the unadjusted model , the ORs of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation be significantly increase as the prealbumin tertiles downgrade . the OR for tertile 1 be significantly high than the OR for tertile 3 ( OR = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for all-cause death ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for ICU admission ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P <0.0001 for mechanical ventilation ) . additional adjustment for the demographic variable and comorbidities do not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in-hospital outcome . further adjust for the baseline level of blood examination , include blood routine ( neutrophil , lymphocyte , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ) , coagulation function ( prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , d-dimer ) , liver fuction ( alanine transaminase , aspartate aminotransferase , total bilirubin ) , renal function ( blood urea nitrogen , creatinine ) and infection indicator ( C-reactive protein ) do not affect the relationship in the fully adjust model ( Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P =0.0006 for all-cause death ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P @card@ for ICU admission ; Or = @card@ ; @card@ % CI , @card@ to @card@ ; P = @card@ for mechanical ventilation ) . therefore , low tertile of prealbumin exhibit an increase risk of bad in-hospital outcome ( full adjusted P for trend for all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation : P < @card@ , P <0.0001 and P = @card@ respectively ) . generalize additive model ( Fig 2 A through 2C ) be use to visually assess functional relationship between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in-hospital outcome . Serum prealbumin be find to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation . To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in-hospital outcome , we conduct stratify analysis ( Table 3 ) . for each unit increase of prealbumin , the adjusted OR for all-cause death be @card@ in male ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ in female ( P = @card@ ) . the adjusted OR for all-cause death for person less than @card@ year of age be @card@ ( P = @card@ ) compare with @card@ ( p = @card@ ) for person @card@ year and old ( P interaction = @card@ ) . for each unit increase of the prealbumin , the OR for all-cause death be @card@ ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ ( P = @card@ ) for normotensives and hypertensive , @card@ ( P = @card@ ) and @card@ ( P = @card@ ) for non-diabetic and diabetes respectively . the difference of interaction be not significant between two group ( P interaction = @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ stratify for gender , age , hypertention and diabetes respectively ) . moreover , the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratify by gender , age , hypertention and diabetes be consistent . in this study , we find that low serum prealbumin significantly associate with an increase risk of bad outcome and all-cause death during hospitalization . patient in the low tertile of prealbumin be old , and with high Neutrophil count , low lymphocyte count , bad coagulation function and liver function compare with subject in the high tertile . then we adjust relevant covariates include age , sex , smoking status , comorbidities , neutrophil , lymphocyte , coagulation function , liver function , renal function and C-reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confound . compare with crude regression analysis , this association still persist when adjust for demographic and clinical variable in the multivariable regression analysis . moreover , stratify by gender , age , hypertension and diabetes , increase level of serum prealbumin be associate with the decrease risk of all-cause death , ICU admission and mechanical ventilation , which determine the consistency of the relationship between low serum prealbumin tertile and the increase risk of bad outcome in elderly COVID-19 patient . several previous study have demonstrate baseline prealbumin change in COVID-19 patient . decrease level of prealbumin be observe among COVID-19 patients10 . Wu C et al investigate @card@ patient with COVID-19 and observe that prealbumin be associate with the development of ARDS , indicate the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID-19 clinical ending11 . till date , no report exist on the effect of prealbumin in COVID-19 elderly patient . high proportion of severe to critical case and high fatality rate be observe in the elderly COVID-19 patient , and rapid disease progress be note in the dead5 . One possible explanation involve the great potential of senior to be in a state of inflammation , nutritional deficiency and other complication . Prealbumin be a globular , non-glycosilated protein , synthesize by the liver , and complexed with a retinol-binding protein , which act as a transporter of retinol/vitamin A and thyroid hormones7 . low plasma prealbumin level have far-back emerge as an early laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status12 , @card@ . in addition , prealbumin be also associate with inflammation . previous study show that in response to the inflammation , the body respond by synthesize a large number of cytokines . these include interleukins and tumor necrosis factor that down-regulate , decrease , plasma concentration of albumin and prealbumin14 , @card@ . therefore , assay of serum prealbumin concentration be recommend by some investigator as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation . elderly with low plasma prealbumin level mean that those people be at great risk of malnutrition and inflammatory condition , which may lead to poor prognosis . malnutrition be commonly see in hospitalize patient in both the developed and develop world , especially among elderly patient . a review of @card@ publish study of acute care patient report that malnutrition incidence range from 42–91 % of hospitalize elderly16 . it be find that compare to non-famine region of India , experience famine have significantly high influenza mortality rate during the @card@ Influenza pandemic17 . aging , frailty , and chronic disease be associate with impaired immune function and be compound by immune dysregulation from malnutrition . when immune response be dysregulated , it would result in an excessive inflammation , even death . in the current COVID-19 study , it be find that elderly patient have high level of white blood cell count , CRP , inflammatory cytokines and be more likely to experience critical disease than do those young patients4 , @card@ . this retrospective cohort study include @card@ elderly COVID-19 patient , until the date of February @card@ , @card@ , @card@ % of patient require mechanical ventilation , @card@ % of patient admit to intensive care unit , and the total in-hospital mortality be @card@ % . the mortality rate be low than that report by Wang L et al5 among elderly COVID-19 patient . this may have be the reason for some patient at the date of February @card@ , @card@ be still in hospital . nevertheless , this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome because of the definite observation time we set previously . moreover , Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the large third-grade class a hospital equip with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality . the result of this study have several clinical implication and strength . a low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regard primarily as a signal identify the at-risk elderly patient who would suffer bad outcome and require careful assessment and monitor for whom nutritional support and inflammation detection may be need as part of the treatment plan19 . as observational study be susceptible to various confounder , we adjust many variable that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in-hospital outcome to minimize potential confound . in addition , we test the robustness of the result by repeat the analysis in different subgroup of gender , age , history of hypertension and history of diabetes . our study have some limitation . first , by include patient still in hospital as of J February @card@ , @card@ , the case fatality ratio in our study can reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID-19 . second , the record of datum may be affect by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset . third , since all subject in our study be hospitalize Chinese elderly patient diagnose with COVID-19 , result of this study might not directly be apply to other ethnicities and age group . in conclusion , this retrospective cohort study reveal that the prealbumin be an independent risk factor for the in-hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID-19 elderly patient . nutritional support and inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patient with low prealbumin concentration .

All the author confirm that there be no plagiarism or self-plagiarism and fabrication of datum .   erythema nodosum-like rash in a COVID-19 patient : a case report Erythema nodosum ( EN ) be a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be trigger by a variety of condition , include infection , drug , pregnancy , malignancy , and inflammatory process . while its pathophysiology be not fully elucidate , EN be most commonly associate with infection , particularly Streptococcus specie [ 6 ] . it occur in both sex and all age range , although more often in woman [ 6 ] . on exam , classic presentation involve the low extremity with patient present with tender , erythematous nodule on bilateral shin . nodule typically resolve on their own without intervention within eight week of onset [ 6 ] . the diagnosis of en be primarily clinical base on history and physical examination . laboratory study and skin biopsy may be consider in atypical presentation to confirm diagnosis . the condition typically resolve spontaneously and therefore treatment target symptom control [ 6 ] . Coronavirus @card@ ( COVID-19)is a novel virus think to infect cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor which can be find on multiple organ system , include skin.1 there have be multiple report of cutaneous manifestation of the disease range from pernio ( chilblain)-like lesion to urticarial rash [ 2 ] . below , the author discuss a case of COVID-19 trigger en . case presentation : a 54-year-old female with history of hypothyroidism and hypertension present to the Emergency Department with chief complaint of new rash develop over the last @card@ H. this erythematous , painful and pruritic rash be diffusely spread over the bilateral upper extremity , chest , neck , back , and face . the patient be confirm positive by nasopharyngeal Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) for COVID-19 @card@ h prior to rash onset . the patient 's review of system be unremarkable . the patient 's initial vital sign be blood pressure of @card@ mmHg , heart rate of @card@ beat per minute , respiratory rate of @card@ breath per minute , oxygen saturation of @card@ % on room air with a temperature of @card@ degree Fahrenheit . on exam the patient have erythematous , non-blanching , circular , raise , tender nodule locate on bilateral upper extremity , chest , back , neck , and face consistent with EN ( Fig 1 . , Fig . 2 , Fig . 3 ) . ulceration and weeping be not note on exam . the patient be discharge with strict return precaution and advise to quarantine per Center for Disease Control guideline . To reduce the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare worker , dermatology be not consult during the patient 's Emergency Department visit base on her clinically stable exam . she be prescribe naproxen and hydroxyzine for symptom control . with the continued rise in COVID-19 case globally , recognize the multitude of disease presentation be key in both treatment of individual and containment of viral spread . the true frequency of cutaneous manifestation be unknown but be estimate to be up to @card@ % of case [ 4 ] . there have be multiple case report and case series outline dermatologic manifestation of COVID-19 . the previously describe exanthems include vesicular , pernio ( chilblain)-like lesion , livedo reticularis , urticarial , petechial , and maculopapular [ @card@ , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] ] . these viral exanthems have be describe to occur throughout various stage of the disease and do not correlate well with severity of illness [ 4 ] . while many case have report dermatologic symptom prior to respiratory symptom , the majority of study have suggest onset a few day after other symptom [ 2 ] . however , the above case describe a novel cutaneous presentation of COVID-19 as well as a unique presentation of en . this particular patient do not warrant hospitalization at the time of presentation , though further case outline the presentation of similar exanthems would be helpful in elucidate timing and severity of illness associate with EN-like eruption in COVID-19 . it be crucial for emergency physician to recognize the variety of COVID-19 manifestation , include dermatologic , to aid in early identification of this highly communicable world-wide disease . erythema nodosum be a self-limiting rash that have be implicate with many know trigger include infection , malignancy , and drug . its identification as possible dermatologic exanthema for COVID-19 be important for early identification , treatment , and quarantine of this disease . earlier identification and recognition of the virus by emergency physician will help improve outcome and mitigate transmission . presentation : none .

[ 7 ]   respond to disaster : form and function of a pharmacy incident command structure the PICS create a hierarchy of role and team contribute to pharmacy-specific incident response effort ( Figure 1 ) . the chief pharmacy officer serve as the incident commander and direct all activity of the PICS . the structure be divide into 6 sections—communications , employee safety , clinical , drug-use policy/formulary , operation , and logistic , each lead by a section chief . each section of the PICS contain multiple pharmacy action team , each of which be assign an action team lead . the pharmacy action team strategically align and integrate with those of the SIM-HICS . several pharmacy action team have a correlate SIM-HICS team , while other operate internally to meet pharmacy-specific need . for those with a correlate SIM-HICS team , pharmacy action team lead also participate as member of the SIM-HICS team and act as liaison between the PICS and SIM-HICS . Pharmacy director be appoint to section chief role by the incident commander and be responsible for provide leadership and oversight of all activity within their domain . pharmacy manager , supervisor , coordinator , and specialist serve as pharmacy action team lead . section chief and action team lead be appoint to position base on their current leadership role , subject matter expertise , and skill set . alternate leader be assign to the incident commander , section chief , and pharmacy action team lead role . they participate in the same capacity as the primary leader to ensure continuity of the PICS activity . Health-system pharmacy administration and leadership ( HSPAL ) resident and pharmacy administrative support staff be assign to project manager role for each PICS section . project manager be responsible for maintain update project plan , prioritizing action team task , and assist with administrative task , such as schedule virtual team meeting . pharmacy specialist , resident , and technician participate in the PICS as pharmacy action team member , play a critical role in decision-making process and plan execution . the corporate structure of the YNHH pharmacy enterprise create a unique opportunity to establish the PICS . the need for accountability , clear communication , manageable leader expectation , and integration among system pharmacy team lead to its inception . principle of the HICS be utilize to create the PICS and ensure alignment of pharmacy response effort to those of the SIM-HICS . the HICS establish role for a complete hospital incident management team and identify 5 primary management section ( Ie , command , operation , planning , logistic , and finance/administration\n",
            ") , each of which have additional associated branch or teams.2 follow an internal assessment , modification be make to the HICS section to optimize the structure for pharmacy use and COVID-19–related challenge . Three unique sections—communications , employee safety , and drug-use policy/formulary—were incorporate into the PICS . addition of the communication section be drive by the need to frequently communicate both internally to a large pharmacy team and externally to various stakeholder across the healthcare system . the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on team member drive the formation of the employee safety section . with adequate medication supply be a top priority of the health system , the drug-use policy/formulary section be strategically incorporate into the PICS to leverage pharmacy expertise . additionally , the planning and finance/administration section of the HICS be collapse in the PICS , and related responsibility be reassign to other PICS section . a timeline of the PICS development and activity during the first several month of the COVID-19 pandemic be represent in Figure 2 . planning and assessment . COVID-19 response planning be facilitate by conduct virtual scenario planning session and utilize a health-system pharmacy department–specific assessment tool . the scenario planning session be conduct to assess potential extreme . Twelve scenario be assess , include infusion center change and support , staff shortage , new patient location ( internal and external ) , patient census surge , vulnerable ambulatory population , sterile compounding change ( to decant or plan to insource ) , severe drug shortages/outages , personal protective equipment shortage , staff burnout , education and training need , communication and coordination , and financial impact . the goal of this exercise be to prepare the PICS for worst-case scenario . each planning session utilize the HICS incident action plan ( IAP ) form to document potential challenge , solution , and resource needs.6 the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists ( ASHP ) COVID-19 pandemic assessment tool for health-system pharmacy department be utilize to identify gap in readiness across the pharmacy enterprise . the 6 category in the tool , include integration with institutional planning , departmental leadership , public and professional education and training , medication and supply , staffing , and public affairs/communications , be assess for vulnerabilities.7 Communication and collaboration be critical to project plan execution ; thus , a dedicated space be create on the pharmacy collaboration website to house project plan and related material . finding from the scenario planning session and assessment be translate into specific objective , strategy , and tactic before be incorporate into a pharmacy action team project plan . all pharmacy action team utilize a standardized project plan template to facilitate timely project execution and reporting . do and colleagues5 recently publish additional detail on the template , include example item from the PICS ambulatory care action team project plan . Pharmacy action team lead meet with their respective team member and project manager to review progress and update the project plan . meeting frequency vary base on individual team need but range from twice-weekly to daily occurrence with additional work meeting as require . section chief regularly meet with their action team lead and project manager to obtain a report on project plan status and provide team with direction . the health system’s proximity to New York City , an early epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak , contribute to rapid increase in patient census . in response , @card@ bed be add , increase the system’s total inpatient capacity to @card@ bed . participant of the PICS often work around the clock , devote most hour to PICS activity to ensure adequate pharmacy support for new bed and increase patient volume . team be require to practice flexibility , replace traditionally perfect execution with be comfortable with “ good enough , ” as quick decision and action be need . the incident commander , section chief , and project manager convene daily to evaluate project plan status , highlight successful strategy completion , and discuss potential barrier . newly identify strategy be assign to pharmacy action team project plan at this time to avoid duplicate assignment between group . action team lead be occasionally invite to this meeting to report on critical initiative and receive guidance . the content of internal and external communication be review daily by the incident commander and section chief . the unique communication strategy utilize by the PICS have be describe previously.4 the incident commander participate in a daily SIM-HICS report-out with other senior health-system executive . during this time , the incident commander utilize information recently report by PICS section chief to share status update on hot topic item , such as drug supply . integration with the SIM-HICS at this level allow for collaboration across discipline and increase access to invaluable system resource . for example , when sharing challenge relate to drug supply monitoring , this integration allow for a quick connection with the Office of Strategy Management ( OSM ) . member of the PICS supply chain action team be then able to collaborate with the OSM , who help build robust reporting tool that allow for precise monitoring of the health system’s supply of critical drug . Pulk and colleagues4 have previously describe the method utilize to leverage big datum to support drug procurement effort . as the COVID-19 patient census begin to wane and the health system begin recovery effort , it become apparent that the system would not revert to “ normal ” practice but would instead define a new normal . the acknowledgment of this transformation lead to renewed PICS initiative that aim to leverage efficiency gain during the emergency response , build upon enhanced communication and collaboration , and inspire the adoption of technology to transform our way of do business . a virtual pharmacy leadership retreat be hold over 2 day focus on identify recovery and transformation strategy with the theme “ be bold enough to leave the past behind . ” Pharmacy leader , include the PICS incident commander , section chief , and action team lead , participate in the retreat . Pharmacy action team be instruct to evaluate exist response-phase project plan in term of the category “ start , ” “ stop , ” or “ continue , ” to brainstorm new objective , and to identify resource need for COVID-19 recovery effort . leader also participate in virtual breakout session to discuss prompt transformational topic such as turbocharging decision-making , envision sustained remote work , and accelerate actionable analytics . at least one individual with expertise relevant to the subject matter be assign to each group . during the retreat , feedback from PICS participant be gather via a survey that assess pharmacy effort during the emergency response and change need to streamline the PICS for recovery and transformation . overall , participant agree on a reduce frequency for report-out and team meeting . additionally , many action team lead request more involvement in meeting with the incident commander and section chief . One significant change to action team structure that result from this survey involve combine the pharmacy automation , information technology , and facilities/equipment action team . Response-phase project plan assessment and breakout session finding from the leadership retreat lead to modify both PICS project plan and the pharmacy multiyear strategic plan . the incident commander , section chief , and project manager review the “ start , ” “ stop , ” or “ continue ” category assign to each PICS response-phase project plan strategy . the remain item result in recovery-phase action team project plan . finding from the transformation breakout session be translate into actionable objective , strategy , and tactic before be incorporate into the strategic plan . the incident commander and section chief alter the PICS to streamline recovery-phase action team project plan , align with health-system recovery effort , and incorporate participant feedback . overall , recovery-phase initiative continue to be execute and monitor similarly to the previous response-phase effort . in alignment with the SIM-HICS , the PICS incident commander’s meeting with section chief be reduce to twice weekly . action team lead be invite to this meeting once weekly to provide reporting . the execution and monitoring of transformation initiative include in the pharmacy strategic plan follow prepandemic process . the pharmacy strategic planning committee utilize strategic planning execution software to assign project and provide define objective . leader responsible for project oversight input datum and provide progress update monthly for review . the development of the PICS structure have several advantage that support team function , reach , and agility . engagement and integration with the SIM-HICS be pivotal to efficient communication with stakeholder . centralized documentation create a collaboration platform for sharing , planning , and access information for quick decision-making . project manager be essential for maintain update documentation , coordinate meeting time , and prioritizing activity . To proficiently navigate the COVID-19 pandemic , engagement of both leadership and frontline staff be critical . the PICS enable us to reinvent the pharmacy enterprise’s governance structure , focus on the pandemic’s immediate demand , expedite decision-making process , and execute plan while maintain the flexibility to pivot base on ever-changing information . the structure allow us to create coordinate system communication , assess and redeploy staff base on demand , and establish a process for daily consensus update to drug-use policy guideline . additionally , integration of the PICS with pertinent SIM-HICS team afford the ability to pool resource , release capital allocation , and document support for governmental stimulus and assistance . the precipitous nature of the COVID-19 pandemic test the will of both pharmacy leader and frontline staff . the success of the YNHH pharmacy enterprise be the result of coordinate , collaborative , and unprecedented effort .   myocarditis and pericarditis follow COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination : practical consideration for Care Providers ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine have identify potential adverse event post-vaccination . recently , datum present to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) report on incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after ∼300,000,000 COVID-19 mRNA dose in the United States . case be much more common follow the second dose , with a preponderance of male affect ( approximately @card@ time more frequent than in female ) . similar to previous report of myocarditis/pericarditis with other vaccine , one suspect that there be likely under-reporting of the true incidence base on subclinical disease . through June 5 , @card@ , an incidence of @card@ case per million second dose in the @card@ year-old age group be observe in the @card@ day follow vaccination , with cluster within the first 6 days.1 Surveillance datum in Canada ( up to July 9 , @card@ ) include @card@ case of myocarditis/pericarditis , where case have be see after 1st and 2nd dose of vaccine , and between 5 hour and @card@ day post exposure.2 these clinical finding be similar to multiple series report worldwide . the reference for these case series can be find in the online supplement . To date , myopericarditis have be report to occur follow both available mRNA vaccine ( Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech ) . standardized case definition be important to understand the true incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination . this pose a number of challenge : the who Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety ( GACVS ) utilize the Brighton Collaboration case definition for myocarditis , which discriminate five level of certainty for the diagnosis . by comparison , the Vaccine adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) in the United States draw from historic case definition for myocarditis , categorize event as suspected , probable or confirm – the latter specifically require the presence of pathognomonic histological finding of myocardial inflammation to be present at biopsy or autopsy . in VAERS , event may be self-reported and adjudication be challenge in the absence of medical record review and confirmatory diagnostic testing . finally , and most relevant to the practitioner , myocarditis and pericarditis diagnostic criterion for the purpose of direct patient care may be different from those use by surveillance system to classify a report event with respect to certainty of diagnosis . in this regard , the CDC working case definition for myocarditis , which categorize case as probable or confirm , good align with our understanding of how myocarditis be currently worked-up in Canada ( a summary of the case definition and reference can be find online , Supplementary Table S1 ) . adverse event follow immunization should be report to the Public Health authority , which in most province and territory be the local Medical Officer of Health ( ttps : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/federal-provincial-territorial-contact-information-aefi-related-questions . html . ) this be important for detection of potential safety signal as well as future immunization recommendation for the individual recipient . Healthcare provider should report any serious or unusual event suspect to be associate with vaccination . definitive proof of a causal association be not necessary , and for many event , can be obtain ; however , event with a clear alternate explanation should not be report . Myocarditis/pericarditis be not a listed adverse event on the current reporting form in most jurisdiction as these be base on the national form ( https : //www . Canada . ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/aefi-form-july23-2020-eng . pdf ) , but should be report as ‘ other event – other serious or unexpected event not list on the form ' . all Canadian province and territory report into the Canadian adverse event follow Immunization Surveillance System ( CAEFISS ) , the national system for detection of serious and rare event that generate estimate of incidence ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss . html ) . CAEFISS have issue weekly summary of report adverse event with a focus on serious event and adverse event of special interest . this process also inform Health Canada , the vaccine regulatory authority , with responsibility for initial authorization of product for use and periodic update to the product monograph include safety finding . such update have be make several time since initial emergency use authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine , initially for the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and capillary leak syndrome , and most recently for the mRNA vaccine with myocarditis/pericarditis . clinician can remain current with such safety signal through subscribe to the MedEffect Canada system ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada . html . ) patient with suspected myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination do not usually require extensive evaluation if symptom be mild . Myocarditis/pericarditis should be suspect in patient present with symptom of chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitation , syncope , diaphoresis , or fatigue without obvious cause , which be also associate with evidence of myocardial injury by elevation in cardiac biomarkers ( i. e. a serum troponin level ) . Serum troponin elevation in myocarditis be often significant ( >10x upper limit of normal ) in patient with myocarditis . ECG change be common and include ST elevation in multiple lead , non-specific ST/T change , and diffuse T wave inversion . the differential diagnosis remain broad and include infectious cause ( viral , bacterial , fungal ) , include acute COVID-19 infection , or post-COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children/Adults ( MIS-C/MIS-A ) , drug and toxin , systemic autoimmune disease , or specific etiology such as sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis . due diligence must be maintain to rule out other cause depend on the clinical presentation ; myocardial ischemia due to coronary disease may also need to be consider in young person with suspicious symptom . suggest evaluation of a patient with high pre-test probability of myocarditis/pericarditis should follow a rational clinical approach ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . careful history and physical examination be indicate for all patient with careful attention to timing of and type of antecedent vaccination . the majority of report suggest typical onset of myocarditis/pericarditis symptom occur within 5 day follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccine exposure . initial evaluation should include an ECG and laboratory test : CBC , electrolyte , renal function , live function test , CRP and troponin , and COVID-19 PCR testing . clinically significant myocarditis be unlikely in the setting of a normal ECG and cardiac biomarkers . normal troponin and a normal ECG on presentation do not exclude isolated pericarditis . treatment should be start if there be a high index of suspicion . the need for more extensive cardiac imaging and additional testing will depend upon the result of the screening test as list above . Echocardiography should be perform in case compatible with myocarditis/pericarditis , especially in the setting of an elevated troponin ( in the absence of an alternative explanation ) . cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may be consider where available and where impact on management can reasonably be expect ( i. e. where echocardiography be normal with elevated troponin , yet clinical suspicion remain high ) . coronary artery imaging should be consider in appropriate case to rule out myocardial infarction as a cause of biomarker/ECG abnormality . an assessment flow diagram can be see in the online Supplementary Figure S1 . there be no clear evidence to support the use of anti-inflammatory therapy for all patient with myocarditis/pericarditis . spontaneous resolution of symptom be reportedly prevalent . overall , the therapeutic approach for symptomatic patient may include pain management and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with or without colchicine ( the latter suggest particularly when pericarditis be the predominant presentation ) . use of intravenous immune-globulins ( IVIG ) , corticosteroid , and biologic immune-modulating agent have be report , and may be consider in severe case . for rare case of hemodynamic instability require inotropic support , patient should be manage at tertiary care centre with capacity for manage cardiogenic shock and critically ill cardiac patient . supportive measure may include inotropic/vasoactive drug , anti-thrombotic therapy , mechanical ventilation , or mechanical circulatory support include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . for patient recover from significant illness , follow-up should be coordinate in consultation with a cardiovascular specialist to provide guidance on further imaging/evaluation , treatment , and return to regular activity as strenuous exercise should be avoid until follow-up assessment . recommendation regard further COVID-19 mRNA vaccination for those with confirmed myocarditis/pericarditis will evolve as evidence emerge . in the near term , it may be prudent to defer or delay the 2nd or subsequent vaccine dose in accordance with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization ( NACI ) guidance.3 consideration of risk with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination have to be balance against the risk of complication from COVID-19 infection . propose mechanism of cardiac involvement in those infected with COVID-19 include sympathetic stimulation , pro-inflammatory effect , myocyte necrosis lead to myocarditis , and heightened risk of arrhythmia and leave ventricular dysfunction . in addition , the hypercoagulable state associate with COVID-19 infection , along with direct vascular infection and concomitant cellular inflammation , contribute to high risk of myocardial infarction . multiple study have report prevalence of cardiac complication in adult after COVID-19 infection , which include heart failure ( @card@ % ) , myocardial injury/myocarditis ( @card@ % ) , arrhythmia ( @card@ % ) and thromboembolism ( @card@ % ) . in those that develop myocarditis with elevated inflammatory biomarkers ( leukocytosis , lymphopenia , d-dimer , c-reactive protein and pro-calcitonin ) and elevated troponin level , high mortality rate ( @card@ % - @card@ % ) have be describe in several case series.4 in contrast to adult , child have be largely spare COVID-19 related acute pulmonary infection and associated complication . however , child be vulnerable to a post-exposure hyperinflammatory syndrome know as MIS-C . this syndrome can result in a severe clinical course require intensive care management . cardiovascular complication from MIS-C include cardiac dysfunction ( @card@ % ) , shock ( @card@ % ) , pericardial effusion ( @card@ % ) , mitral regurgitation ( @card@ % ) , myocarditis ( @card@ % ) , heart failure ( @card@ % ) , and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm ( @card@ % ) , with a mortality rate of @card@ in light of current knowledge , it be reasonable to consider that despite the rarity of potential adverse outcome follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis/pericarditis in both adult and child , the benefit from the vaccine in avoid COVID-19 infection and its related complication outweigh the risk . base on the current state of knowledge regard the potential association between mRNA vaccination and myocarditis/pericarditis , “ take away message ” for cardiovascular care provider can be articulate . these include : • the estimated incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis follow COVID-19 mRNA vaccination across different age group be likely to change with additional datum ; at present this be a rare event , with most report suggest incidence of 1 case per @card@ vaccination . • the majority of myocarditis/pericarditis case have be report follow a second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination , with great incidence in male . presentation be usually early ( within the first week ) follow vaccination . • the majority of myocarditis/pericarditis case report have be mild and self-limited . severe case present as more fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock be exceedingly rare and likely merit more extensive investigation to exclude other cause . • the approach to investigation should be tailor to the clinical presentation . suspected case require a careful history and physical exam , ECG , routine laboratory work and consideration for echocardiography . patient with significant symptom and routine testing supportive of a diagnosis of myocarditis/pericarditis should undergo additional cardiac investigation with specialized testing base on availability and likelihood of an impact on clinical management . • suspected case should be report to the Public Health adverse event follow Immunization Reporting System ( https : //www . canada . ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/reporting-adverse-events-following-immunization . html ) by the health care

consideration for practitioner . case tend to be mild , do not usually require specific intervention , and potential risk of the vaccine be outweigh by the well-defined risk of COVID-19 infection . vaccination continue to be recommend in all eligible individual . a thoughtful approach to evaluation , management and report of suspected case of myocarditis/pericarditis be indicate as a key public health measure . none no source of funding be obtain for this work   Factors Associated with racial difference in Deaths among Nursing Home Residents with COVID-19 Infection in the US Deaths associate with coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) infection in the US have be disproportionately high among individual from racial and ethnic minority group compare with White individuals.1 give that @card@ % of COVID-19 death have be associate with long-term care facilities,2 it be not surprising that the disparity observe among individual with COVID-19 in the general population be also present among nurse home resident with COVID-19.3 in this study , we investigate the difference in COVID-19 case and death by the racial composition of nurse home resident and examine the factor associate with the high rate of COVID-19 death find in nurse home with the large proportion of resident from racial and ethnic minority group . before the COVID-19 pandemic begin , it be well establish that racial disparity in the quality of nurse home care be common.4 relative to White individual , Black individual be more likely to be admit to the lowest-quality nursing homes,5 which have low nurse staffing ratio , more serious regulatory deficiency , and a high likelihood of be terminate from the Medicaid program.6,7,8 disparity in care appear to be largely a function of where people go for care rather than differential treatment by staff member within the same facility , as nursing home be highly segregated.8 these disparity have also be associate with payment source . nursing home be primarily fund by public payer , with approximately two-third of resident in a typical facility cover by Medicaid insurance , and the proportion of resident with Medicaid coverage at the facility level have be associate with between-facility ( but not within-facility ) difference in quality , broadly defined.7 disparity in COVID-19 death may be expect give these difference in nurse home quality , but research to date have reveal little association between nurse home quality rating and COVID-19 case and deaths.9,10,11 Nursing home with high proportion of non-white resident may be especially susceptible to COVID-19 death for several additional reason that be more specific to the nature of the pandemic.12 First , non-white resident be more likely to live in facility that be large , which create more opportunity for viral transmission . second , non-white resident generally enter nursing home in bad health,13 which may be associate with high COVID-19 mortality . third , non-white resident be more likely to live in facility that be for profit , more reliant on Medicaid , and have deficiency in care.7,14,15 fourth , COVID-19 be more prevalent in non-white community , and community spread be a factor associate with case and death in nurse homes.10,11 our goal in this study be to investigate the racial factor associate with COVID-19 death among nurse home resident by examine the association between the racial composition of nurse home resident and COVID-19 death and assess whether that association be attenuate when facility size , case mix , other facility characteristic , and community prevalence of COVID-19 be take into account . the primary outcome be facility-level count of COVID-19 death among nurse home resident as self-reported by nurse home begin between January 1 , @card@ , and May @card@ , @card@ , and end on September @card@ , @card@ . we also examine the total number of confirm and suspect COVID-19 case among resident over the same period . confirmed case be define as COVID-19 infection confirm by a diagnostic laboratory test . suspected case be define as sign and/or symptom of COVID-19 infection or patient-specific transmission-based precaution for COVID-19 infection . we calculate the number of facility-level death per @card@ case from these 2 measure . nursing home racial composition be measure as the proportion of resident of non-Hispanic White race contain in the LTCfocus database , group into 5 racial composition quintile across the sample . quintile category be base on the percentage of nurse home resident who be White ( quintile 1 indicate 0 % to @card@ % , quintile 2 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , quintile 3 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , quintile 4 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % , and quintile 5 indicate @card@ % to @card@ % ) . the proportion of White resident be derive from self-reported datum provide by nurse home resident as part of Minimum Data Set assessment . the available datum do not allow us to examine all non-white group separately . however , to assess possible difference among group that we could identify , we use an alternative categorization of nurse home in supplemental analysis , classify home as have high proportion of White , Black , Hispanic or Hispanic and Black resident by use the percentage of resident in each of the 3 race/ethnicity category available in the LTCfocus database . case mix be measure use the LTCfocus acuity index and the proportion of resident with hypertension . the acuity index capture functional limitation and cognitive impairment among a facility’s resident . acuity index score be calculate by LTCfocus at the facility level , and score range from 0 to @card@ , with 0 indicate no functional or cognitive impairment among any of the resident and @card@ indicate severe limitation and the need for several specialized service among all resident . in the nursing home include in this study , acuity index score range from 0 to @card@ . we control for nurse home characteristic that be report to be associate with COVID-19 death in previous studies10,11 ; these characteristic include the number of certified bed ( which be use as a proxy for facility size ) , nurse home ownership ( for-profit , government , or nonprofit ) , chain membership , payer mix ( Medicaid and Medicare ) , Nursing Home Compare overall star rating ( range , @card@ star , with 1 star indicate low quality and 5 star indicate high quality ) , and case mix–adjusted nursing hour ( measure as hour per resident per day ) . community spread be measure as the number of confirmed COVID-19 case ( exclude case among nurse home resident ) per @card@ people in the county . first , we compute unadjusted mean to describe the characteristic of nurse home by racial composition quintile . next , we use multivariable regression model to estimate the marginal effect of quintile for the number of death , sequentially add adjustment for number of bed , case mix , other facility characteristic , and county-level COVID-19 case . because the number of death be a count outcome that include a large number of facility report 0 death , we use zero-inflated negative binomial models.17 we also repeat the main analysis use negative binomial model to determine the extent to which the finding be sensitive to the specific count datum model use ( eTable 3 in the supplement ) . To aid the interpretation of the regression analysis result , we report average marginal effect estimate and sis for each quintile relative to the base category of quintile 5 , which represent the group of nurse home with the high proportion of White resident . we also use stratification , divide the sample into 5 group base on the nursing home ' overall star rating from the Nursing Home Compare archives to examine whether association observe in the full sample be different for nurse home with different rating . Stata software , version @card@ ( StataCorp LLC ) be use for all analysis . statistical test be 2-sided with a significance threshold of P < @card@ . datum be analyze from July @card@ to December @card@ , @card@ . among @card@ @card@ nursing home include in the study , the mean ( SD ) age of resident be @card@ ( @card@ ) year , and @card@ % be female . as of September @card@ , @card@ , @card@ @card@ COVID-19 case and @card@ @card@ COVID-19–associated death be report among resident , with a mean ( SD ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) death per facility . a total of @card@ @card@ nursing home ( @card@ % ) report at least 1 COVID-19 case , and @card@ nursing home ( @card@ % ) report at least 1 COVID-19–associated death . the mean ( SD ) proportion of White resident be @card@ % ( @card@ % ) , range from less than @card@ % in quintile 1 facility to more than @card@ % in quintile 5 facility ( Table 1 ) . the mean ( SD ) number of death in nurse home with the high proportion of non-white resident ( quintile 1 ) vs nursing home with the high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) and @card@ ( @card@ ) , respectively . compare with nurse home with high proportion of non-white resident ( quintile 1 ) , nurse home with high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be locate in county with few confirmed COVID-19 case per capita ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] case per @card@ people vs @card@ [ @card@ ] case per @card@ people ) , be less likely to be for profit ( @card@ facility [ @card@ % ] vs @card@ facility [ @card@ % ] ) , and have few certified bed ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] bed vs @card@ [ @card@ ] bed ) , good resident health as measure by the acuity index ( mean [ SD ] score , @card@ [ @card@ ] vs @card@ [ @card@ ] ) and the percentage of resident with hypertension ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , a low proportion of resident with Medicaid coverage ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , a high proportion of resident with Medicare coverage ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident vs @card@ % [ @card@ % ] resident ) , high star rating ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] star vs @card@ [ @card@ ] star ) , and high nursing hour ( mean [ SD ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] hour per resident per day vs @card@ [ @card@ ] hour per resident per day ) ( Table 1 ) . the number of COVID-19 case and death decrease monotonically with the percentage of White resident ( Figure 1 ) . the mean ( SD ) number of case among nurse home with the high proportion of White resident ( quintile 5 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) , while the mean ( SD ) number of case among nurse home with the low proportion of White resident ( quintile 1 ) be @card@ ( @card@ ) ( Table 1 ) . facility in quintile 1 experience a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than those in quintile 5 , represent a 3.3-fold high number of death in quintile 1 compare with the mean ( SD ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) death among facility in quintile 5 . the mean ( SD ) number of facility-level death per @card@ case be @card@ ( @card@ ) among facility in quintile 1 , which be 2-fold high than the mean ( SD ) number of @card@ ( @card@ ) death per @card@ case among facility in quintile 5 ( Table 1 ) . these unadjusted difference in death count by nursing home racial composition decrease when sequentially adjust for characteristic that differ across the nursing home quintile group . after adjustment for the number of certified bed in a facility , nurse home in quintile 1 be associate with a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than facility in quintile 5 ( figure 2 ; eTable 2 in the supplement ) . adjust for case mix and additional nurse home characteristic do not modify this association . an analysis adjust for county-level COVID-19 case indicate further reduction in the difference between racial group ; however , even in the fully adjust model , nurse home with the high proportion of non-white resident have a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) additional COVID-19 death compare with nurse home with the low proportion of non-white resident . nursing home with more certified bed ( marginal effect [ SE ] of a 1-unit increase in the natural log of the number of certified bed , @card@ [ @card@ ] death ) , large proportion of resident with hypertension ( marginal effect [ Se ] , @card@ [ @card@ ] ) , few resident with Medicare coverage ( marginal effect [ Se ] , −0.013 [ @card@ ] ) , and few hour of nursing care ( marginal effect [ Se ] , −0.549 [ @card@ ] ) have more COVID-19–associated death ( eTable 3 in the supplement ) . these association be largely consistent within each of the Nursing Home Compare star rating category in the stratify analysis ( Table 2 ) . however , the difference in death count by racial composition be large among 1-star ( lowest-quality ) facility . for example , among 1-star facility , nurse home in quintile 1 have a mean ( SE ) of @card@ ( @card@ ) more death than those in quintile 5 , which represent the large marginal effect for quintile 1 of any of the star-rating category . the marginal effect of adjusted nursing hour per resident per day be only statistically significant for nurse home with 4 or 5 star and not those with low star rating . in the secondary analysis , we examine whether these association be different when nursing home be classify as have high proportion of Black or Hispanic resident . the unadjusted number of case and death be highest among nurse home with the high proportion of Black and Hispanic resident ( eFigure 1 in the supplement ) . in addition , as observe in the classification by percentage of White resident only , the difference be moderate by control for the number of certified bed and county-level case but not by control for case mix or other nurse home characteristic ( eFigure 2 in the supplement ) . result be also similar in an analysis use only confirm case ( eFigure 3 in the supplement ) and case among staff ( eFigure 4 in the supplement ) . the association between nurse home racial composition and death be consistent when examine datum from early in the pandemic ( May to June @card@ ) vs later in the pandemic ( July to September @card@ ) ( eTable 4 , eTable 5 , and eFigure 5 in the supplement ) . the number of facility-level death per @card@ case decrease over time ; however , the association between a high proportion of White resident and a low number of death per @card@ case be consistent in both of the period examine ( eTable 6 in the supplement ) . this study have several limitation . first , although facility-level characteristic be important , the current study be limit by the lack of individual-level datum on COVID-19 case and death among nurse home resident to study these disparity more explicitly . Individual-level datum be need to understand whether there be within-facility disparity in addition to the between-facility disparity identify in this study . more generally , future research use individual-level datum on COVID-19 case and death among nurse home resident be warrant to well understand the individual-level risk factor associate with bad COVID-19 outcome , include mortality , among this disproportionally impact population . second , our datum do not allow for racial classification other than White , Black , and Hispanic . more detailed datum on race and ethnicity be need to examine whether there be difference in COVID-19 outcome among the diverse non-white group . third , COVID-19 case and death count be self-reported , and nursing home be only require to report these count begin in mid-May @card@ , which omit many previous case and death from our analysis . fourth , our case mix variable may not capture all relevant aspect of health . Fifth , this study be a cross-sectional observational analysis that may not represent causal association . consistent with historical racial disparity in long-term care and current pandemic-associated death , this study’s result suggest that nursing home with high proportion of non-white resident be experience the bad COVID-19 outcome . disparity in death by nursing home racial composition be associate with the disproportionately high spread of the disease in non-white community and the characteristic of the nursing home that serve those community .   predictor of readmission require hospitalization after discharge from emergency department in patient with COVID-19 in December @card@ , an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) , occur in China , and , thereafter , it have dramatically spread worldwide [ @card@ ] . Italy be the first western country experience the unexpected , devastating impact of this pandemic , with an outstanding number of infected patient admit to emergency department ( editor ) in a relatively small amount of time . due to the high pressure to healthcare system over those week , some of them , deem as less severe , be discharge home [ 3 ] . although several study have report readmission rate after hospitalization and relative predictor , little be not know on prevalence of early hospital return of patient non-hospitalized [ [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . the aim of this study be to describe short-term return hospital admission ( within @card@ day ) of patient with mild and moderate COVID-19 discharge from two major ed within the Marche region ( an Italian region of @card@ million of inhabitant ) during the first wave , and to identify predictor of return hospital admission . we conduct a retrospective cohort study of adult patient with COVID-19 discharge from the two EDs of major hospital of the Marche Region ( “ Ospedali Riuniti ” Ancona , the coordinator centre ; “ Marche Nord ” Hospital , Pesaro , Italy ) from March 1 to April @card@ , @card@ . this date range be base on volume . the annual census be approximately @card@ and @card@ respectively in Ancona 's Ed and Pesaro 's editor . the whole inpatient capacity for COVID patient be @card@ . the decision to obtain imaging , and/or discharge be determine by the attend physician at his/her discretion . a specific hospital algorithm be not available . Anonymized datum of patient be collect from electronic medical record . patient be include in the study cohort if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal swab specimen within 7 day before or after the ED encounter [ 8 ] and be discharge from editor . we collect for all case : i ) demographic factor : sex , age , duration of symptom before ED visit ; ii ) comorbidities : hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia , cognitive impairment ( determine by the review of the anamnesis ) and other ; iii ) risk factor : being resident in care facility , fever , tachycardia , pulse oximetry on room air ( SatHb ≤94 % vs > @card@ % ) , PaO2/FiO2 ( P/F  @card@ mmHg or vs not available ) , pro-calcitonin , chest radiograph ( abnormal vs normal or vs not perform ) , age > @card@ year , neutrophilia , lactate dehydrogenase >100 U/L , C-reactive protein >3 mg/L and D-dimer >1000 μg/mL , the last five know to be associate with a poor prognosis [ @card@ ] . return hospital admission be define as an unscheduled return editor visit require hospitalization within @card@ days. we compare the group of patient who have a return hospital admission vs the group of patient who have not . the latter group include both patient who have not unscheduled return editor visit and those who have unscheduled return editor visit within @card@ day , but be then discharge again . descriptive statistic be use to summarize covariates and unadjusted outcome . continuous variable be assess with the unpaired Welch 's t-test if normally distribute and the Mann Whitney U test if not , use NCSS v20.0.2 . a p value <0.05 be consider statistically significant . during the study period , there be @card@ patient attend the two EDs and @card@ patient test positive for SARS-CoV-2 with an admission percentage of @card@ % . a total of @card@ subject be discharge and include in the present study . overall , the mean age be @card@ year ( range 18–95 year ) , there be a slight predominance of male gender ( @card@ % ) and the median duration of symptom be 9 day ( range 1–25 day ) . Sixty-five patient ( @card@ % ) have an unscheduled return editor visit within @card@ day , with the majority of whom ( @card@ % ) within @card@ days. of these , @card@ patient ( @card@ % [ @card@ % CI 9–17 ] ) be then hospitalize ( define a return hospital admission ) , while the remaining @card@ be again discharge . demographic and clinical characteristic at baseline ( i. e. on first hospital admission ) , for all patient and accord to the need of return hospital admission , be summarize in Table 1 . patient require a return hospital admission be significantly old ( @card@ year [ @card@ % CI 53.77–57.51 ] vs @card@ [ @card@ % CI 62.97–73.20 ] year , p < @card@ ) , have high pro-calcitonin ( @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.04–0.18 ] vs. @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.03–0.10 ] ng/mL , p < @card@ ) and D-dimer level ( @card@ [ @card@ % CI 445–2074 ] vs. @card@ [ @card@ % CI 529–730 ] μg/mL , p < @card@ ) . major predictor of return hospital admission be cognitive impairment ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 4.7–63.2 ] , p < @card@ ) , P/F  @card@ mmHg have low odd ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.1–0.5 ] , p = @card@ ) of return hospital admission compare to the group with hypoxia , as well as those with no comorbidities ( Or @card@ [ @card@ % CI 0.1–0.7 ] , p = @card@ ) compare to those with almost one comorbidity ( Table 1 ) . To our knowledge , this be the first study assess prevalence and predictor of return hospital admission of patient with COVID-19 follow an initial editor discharge in Italy during the first wave . the prevalence be @card@ % , approximately two-time high than those report in three previous non- European cohort [ [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . however , in two of these study , readmission rate be assess within the first @card@ h from ED discharge . in the study by Kilaru et al . [ 5 ] , indeed , the rate of readmission increase to @card@ % when record at 7 days. Older age ( ≥ @card@ year ) , cognitive impairment , residence in geriatric care facility , comorbidities , hypoxia and neutrophilia be associate with a high probability of subsequent return hospital admission . age-related condition , in particular presence of dementia , seem to play a relevant role , likely due to the challenging assessment of initial clinical impairment as well as to the difficulty relate with management and monitoring of these patient , even in dedicated setting . in addition , our finding about neutrophilia and consequent lymphopenia corroborate datum suggest an association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and disease severity [ @card@ ] . of note , the presence of hypoxia at arterial blood gas analysis be a significant predictor of return hospital admission , while have a saturation ≤ @card@ % be not , underline the importance of a proper gas analysis assessment for a more precise risk stratification . not perform a arterial blood gas analysis be , indeed , significantly associate with a high risk of return hospital admission . on the other hand , it would be reasonable to speculate that a patient who be well enough to not require a blood gas analysis , would not have expect to return to hospital . in time of significant pressure to healthcare system , it may not be feasible to admit all patient at first presentation , even when they present with not negligible clinical feature . therefore , it be crucial to safely discharge subject with low risk for readmission , in order to prioritize bed availability . in this context , identify major predictor for return hospital admission might be a useful tool to develop and validate an algorithm for risk stratification [ [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ] . this study have several limitation . first , the small sample size of this study be a limitation . second , the limited representativeness of datum , that come from two ed only , as indication to admission and discharge might be different accord to hospital , be influence by internal guideline and the entity of pressure to health system . moreover , we could miss a number of return hospital admission , because some patient could subsequently go to other hospital or die at home . however , it be unlikely that patient go elsewhere because there be no other hospital in nearby radius . a further limitation be that we do not include the full range of potential risk factor as covariates associate with readmission , such as obesity or discharge medication . lastly , due to the retrospective nature of the study , more detailed datum on comorbidities or treatment prescribe at home be not available . in conclusion , we find that approximately @card@ % of patient with COVID-19 , initially discharge from the editor , return for an unscheduled editor visit with hospitalization within @card@ days. selected epidemiological and clinical characteristic , such as old age , hypoxia define by P/F , and cognitive impairment be independently associate with an increase likelihood of return hospital admission . further investigation be need to develop risk stratification tool , which help physician to choose the good disposition for patient with COVID-19 in the editor .

Atorvastatin associate with decrease hazard for death in COVID-19 patient admit to an ICU : a retrospective cohort study To the editor , since the World Health Organization ( who ) declare the coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) a pandemic , the medical community start a race against time to find effective treatment for this disease [ 1 ] . Atorvastatin as adjuvant immunomodulatory therapy be of particular interest give its low cost , know safety profile , and availability . the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) have be show to interact with Toll-like receptor on the host cell membrane , increase the expression of the MYD88 gene , ultimately activate NF-κB and trigger inflammatory pathway . experimental model have demonstrate that statins stabilize MYD88 level after a pro-inflammatory trigger , and , in a murine model , atorvastatin significantly attenuate NF-κB activation [ 2 ] . furthermore , in the real world , two retrospective cohort study report a reduce risk of influenza death among statin user [ 3 , 4 ] . therefore , we assess whether statin user at a dose of @card@ mg daily have reduce inpatient mortality hazard from COVID-19 . in this retrospective cohort study , we use a de-identified dataset that include @card@ adult patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admit to our community hospital intensive care unit ( ICU ) locate in Evanston , Il , from March to May @card@ . we perform a Cox proportional hazard ( PH ) regression model to examine the relationship between adjuvant treatment and inpatient mortality . To minimize confounder , we adjust for age , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , invasive mechanical ventilation , severity accord to the National Institutes of Health criterion ( respiratory rate > @card@ , SpO2 < @card@ % , PaO2/FiO2  @card@ % ) , number of comorbidities ( as a continuous variable ) , and other adjuvant therapy ( include hydroxychloroquine , intravenous steroid , azithromycin , tocilizumab , colchicine , and antibiotic ) , force these variable into the model . we also perform a sensitivity analysis calculate the E value ( with the low confidence limit ) as describe by VanderWeele et al . [ 5 , 6 ] for the obtain point estimate . the E value be define as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome , conditional on the measure covariates , to explain away a specific exposure-outcome association fully . the median age be @card@ year ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 58–75 year ) , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be male , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) be skilled nurse facility resident . of these patient , @card@ ( @card@ % ) be ultimately discharge from the hospital , median length of stay @card@ day ( IQR , 7 to @card@ day ) , and @card@ ( @card@ % ) have die , median length of stay @card@ day ( IQR , 3 to @card@ day ) , a statistically significant difference ( p = @card@ by Mann-Whitney U test ) . a total of @card@ ( @card@ % ) survivor receive atorvastatin @card@ mg daily compare to @card@ ( @card@ % ) of non-survivors ( p = @card@ by chi-squared ) . in the multivariable Cox PH regression model , atorvastatin non-user have a @card@ % chance of fast progression to death compare with atorvastatin user ( when probability = HR/HR + 1 ) ( Table 1 ) . the E value for the point estimate be @card@ and the E value for the low confidence interval be @card@ , mean that a confounder not include in the multivariable Cox PH regression model associate with atorvastatin use and inpatient mortality in patient with COVID-19 by a hazard ratio of 1.69-fold each could explain away the low confidence limit , but weak confound could not . in conclusion , we find a slow progression to death associate with atorvastatin in patient with COVID-19 admit to our ICU . give the observational nature of this study , result should be take with caution ; randomize controlled trial be need to confirm this benefit ( STATCO19 , identifier NCT04380402 ) . To date , supportive care remain the mainstay of therapy , and the clinical efficacy for various treatment be still under investigation .   chest CT Features of @card@ patient with Mild Coronavirus Disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) Pneumonia : a Longitudinal , Retrospective and Descriptive Study this article be publish with digital feature , include a summary slide , to facilitate understanding of the article . To view digital feature for this article go to https : //doi . org/10.6084/m9 . figshare.13007915 . the World Health Organization ( who ) report that as of July 6 , @card@ , there be ten million confirm case of coronavirus disease @card@ ( COVID-19 ) worldwide , include @card@ death [ 1 ] . these figure be update daily , and subsequently , the situation have largely deteriorate depend on geographical location . among confirm case report in China , @card@ % of @card@ patient experience mild pneumonia [ 2 ] . compute tomography ( CT ) be instrumental for screening and effective evaluation of patient with COVID-19 [ 3 ] , and understand CT performance be of vital clinical significance for control the pandemic . nevertheless , to our knowledge , the scope of study investigate the evolution of CT finding in COVID-19 be limit [ 4–9 ] . for example , Wang et al . [ 5 ] , Zhou et al . [ 6 ] , and Pan et al . [ 8 ] focus on the evolution of imaging performance within @card@ or @card@ day after the onset of symptom , while more than @card@ or @card@ day after illness onset be classify as the last stage . however , the time from illness onset to ICU admission be @card@ ( IQR 8 , @card@ ) day [ @card@ ] . therefore , focus on @card@ or @card@ day after illness onset as the last stage may obscure a critical change in disease course . furthermore , certain study [ 6–9 ] analyze patient with mild as well as severe pneumonia , which may bias the result . for example , Liang et al . [ 4 ] analyze only the CT finding of patient who be not discharge from the hospital during the first 3 week after admission , and Shi et al . include only the initial CT date of all patient [ 7 ] . therefore , a large-scale longitudinal study on the CT manifestation of patient with mild COVID-19 pneumonia be urgently require . here we describe the evolution of CT appearance in @card@ patient with mild COVID-19 with definitive outcome ( all patient be discharge and none become severely or critically ill or die ) . we aim to compare the CT finding across the disease course and analyze the correlation between CT score and inpatient day , which may be helpful for understand the nature of disease and for optimally manage patient . chest CT image without contrast be acquire use a single inspiratory phase use two CT scanner ( SOMATOM Definition AS , Siemens Healthineers , Erlangen , Germany ; uCT @card@ , United Imaging , Shanghai , China ) . all patient be supine when examine . the CT protocol be as follow : @card@ kVp ; 120–200 mA ; slice thickness 5–10 mm. ; matrix @card@ × @card@ ; pitch @card@ . the reconstruction section thickness be 0.5–1 mm. . we collect CT scan of patient from admission to discharge . Two radiologist with @card@ and @card@ year of experience in chest imaging , respectively , evaluate the CT image to reach a consensus diagnosis . definition of CT imaging feature refer to in the Fleischner Society glossary and peer-reviewed literature on viral pneumonia [ 7 , 14–16 ] . the observer review the image feature as follow : lung involvement , extent of lesion involvement , predominant location , margin definition , distribution , lung segment of lesion distribution , number of lung segment and lobe involved , predominant CT pattern ( Fig . 2 ) , pure ground-glass opacity ( GGO ) , pure consolidation , GGO and consolidation , linear opacity , adjacent pleuron thickening , nodule , round\n",
